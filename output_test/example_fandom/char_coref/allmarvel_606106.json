{"document": "Anthony Edward Stark was a certified genius , a well known billionaire , and an infamous playboy . He had inherited his fortune , that much was true , but he certainly had n't rested on his laurels - he had more than done his part to increase it . He had revolutionised weapons technology in the twenty first century , developing newer , smarter missiles , warheads , guidance systems , defence , in some cases , though he had always lived by his father 's maxim : \" Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy . \" He spent his life on the traditional pleasures : wine , women , and song . Or at least , he did in the public eye . Many wondered how he had gone so long without a single relationship in his life - he could laugh it off easily enough , that was true , but the real truth of it was that there was a fourth love in his life , a demanding mistress , and a relationship which was toxic , occasionally to the extreme . First , and foremost , before anything else , Tony Stark had his work . It was his work which kept him up for 72 hours straight , sometimes more , which left him dizzy with exhaustion , completely worn , but buzzing too much to rest , it was the perfectionist streak in him which drove him to hide there , striving to meet a set of standards imagined in his father 's voice , to which he could never measure up . It was easier to hide in his work , to not let the world see what a weak and pathetic failure he truly was . It had become harder to simply hide in his work after the Avengers initiative had been set up . Team mates had this annoying habit of sticking their noses into business where they did n't belong . He had been under pressure to give the team a home , after all , the rest of them were , for the most part , stuck in SHIELD quarters , and were jealous of the fact that he had taken Doctor Banner in . He liked Bruce , and Bruce understood about work , about science and tech . And the guy did n't have anywhere else to be . He found it reassuring that Bruce kept hours that were almost as erratic and unhealthy as Tony 's own . It somehow condoned his own slow self destruction . He never took Christmas off , but nobody knew that - why would they ? It was easy to duck out of social engagements , because as far as everyone was concerned it was almost certain that he would have another engagement , a prior one , or a more impressive one , which outranked theirs , and so he played those off against each other . He gave the staff of Stark Tower - few though there were - the day off , at the very least , the week , for all non - essential staff , and so there was no one , had never been anyone , to bear witness to Tony Stark spending Christmas alone in his workshop with a bottle or three of scotch , and the bots . He never achieved anything productive , but losing himself in work sure beat all the forced cheer he could never quite stomach . It was Christmas Eve , late , midnight possibly ? He did n't know , he was n't keeping track , engineering blindly on a tide of caffeine and alcohol . He hardly drank these days , but it helped keep the memories at bay . Memories of Christmas ... he had enough for a lifetime . He did n't buy all the bullshit about the true spirit of the holiday . How could he ? He knew for a fact it did n't exist . He had n't slept in twenty four hours , and so was n't surprised when the workshop began to waver . Had he eaten ? He was n't quite sure of that either ... He was quite surprised , though , when Captain Steve Rogers appeared before him , and seemingly guided him to sit on the couch he kept in the workshop for those occasions when he passed out , handing him a plate with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on it , the same way he usually did when he was of the opinion Tony needed to eat something , whether that be before a mission , after a mission ... after a bender , first thing in the morning , last thing at night ... the man seemed to have a complex about food , but then , Tony supposed , if you were used to there not being much of it around , the novelty of having plenty never quite wore off . Tony tried to ask him what he was doing there , but the man just smiled , and so , irritated , Tony took a swipe , only half in play , and blinked as his hand went right through Steve 's chest , or where his eyes were telling him Steve 's chest should be . Well , this was a first , he 'd never hallucinated Steve Rogers before , but that being said , it was a hallucination he would have been quite happy to have again . \" Well , I guess it 's kinda neat that you picked my face for the past , even if it is n't really a surprise ... I 'm kinda wondering why you did n't pick your dad , except ... well , I guess we 're about to find out about that ... \" he smiled sadly \" I get that this time of year is n't easy for you ... mind if we take a look at the old days ? Seeing as I did n't get to live through them myself ... \" Tony was more than a little wary of the idea of looking through the old memories . As far as he was concerned , he kept them back for a reason . He did n't need the years of coldness freezing his non - existent heart all over again .", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [0, 3], "text": "Anthony Edward Stark"}, {"position": [18, 19], "text": "He"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text": "his"}, {"position": [30, 31], "text": "he"}, {"position": [36, 37], "text": "his"}, {"position": [39, 40], "text": "he"}, {"position": [44, 45], "text": "his"}, {"position": [50, 51], "text": "He"}, {"position": [79, 80], "text": "he"}, {"position": [84, 85], "text": "his"}, {"position": [102, 103], "text": "He"}, {"position": [104, 105], "text": "his"}, {"position": [122, 123], "text": "he"}, {"position": [132, 133], "text": "he"}, {"position": [142, 143], "text": "his"}, {"position": [145, 146], "text": "he"}, {"position": [171, 172], "text": "his"}, {"position": [199, 201], "text": "Tony Stark"}, {"position": [202, 203], "text": "his"}, {"position": [207, 208], "text": "his"}, {"position": [211, 212], "text": "him"}, {"position": [223, 224], "text": "him"}, {"position": [244, 245], "text": "him"}, {"position": [247, 248], "text": "him"}, {"position": [261, 262], "text": "his"}, {"position": [268, 269], "text": "he"}, {"position": [280, 281], "text": "his"}, {"position": [295, 296], "text": "he"}, {"position": [307, 308], "text": "his"}, {"position": [336, 337], "text": "He"}, {"position": [374, 375], "text": "he"}, {"position": [381, 382], "text": "He"}, {"position": [407, 408], "text": "He"}, {"position": [423, 424], "text": "Tony"}, {"position": [430, 431], "text": "his"}, {"position": [436, 437], "text": "He"}, {"position": [473, 474], "text": "he"}, {"position": [495, 496], "text": "he"}, {"position": [503, 504], "text": "He"}, {"position": [551, 553], "text": "Tony Stark"}, {"position": [557, 558], "text": "his"}, {"position": [571, 572], "text": "He"}, {"position": [579, 580], "text": "himself"}, {"position": [588, 589], "text": "he"}, {"position": [604, 605], "text": "He"}, {"position": [609, 610], "text": "he"}, {"position": [625, 626], "text": "He"}, {"position": [644, 645], "text": "he"}, {"position": [651, 652], "text": "He"}, {"position": [668, 669], "text": "he"}, {"position": [670, 671], "text": "He"}, {"position": [680, 681], "text": "He"}, {"position": [702, 703], "text": "he"}, {"position": [705, 706], "text": "He"}, {"position": [714, 715], "text": "He"}, {"position": [727, 728], "text": "him"}, {"position": [732, 733], "text": "him"}, {"position": [752, 753], "text": "him"}, {"position": [777, 778], "text": "Tony"}, {"position": [822, 823], "text": "Tony"}, {"position": [848, 849], "text": "Tony"}, {"position": [854, 855], "text": "he"}, {"position": [870, 871], "text": "Tony"}, {"position": [883, 884], "text": "his"}, {"position": [898, 899], "text": "him"}, {"position": [912, 913], "text": "he"}, {"position": [929, 930], "text": "he"}, {"position": [971, 972], "text": "you"}, {"position": [975, 976], "text": "your"}, {"position": [994, 995], "text": "he"}, {"position": [1009, 1010], "text": "you"}, {"position": [1024, 1025], "text": "I"}, {"position": [1032, 1033], "text": "myself"}, {"position": [1035, 1036], "text": "Tony"}, {"position": [1055, 1056], "text": "he"}, {"position": [1059, 1060], "text": "he"}, {"position": [1067, 1068], "text": "He"}, {"position": [1076, 1077], "text": "his"}], "name": "Tony"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [84, 86], "text": "his father"}, {"position": [261, 263], "text": "his father"}, {"position": [975, 977], "text": "your dad"}], "name": "his father"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [318, 320], "text": "Team mates"}, {"position": [343, 345], "text": "the team"}], "name": "Team mates"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [383, 384], "text": "Bruce"}, {"position": [386, 387], "text": "Bruce"}, {"position": [397, 399], "text": "the guy"}, {"position": [412, 413], "text": "Bruce"}], "name": "Bruce"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [722, 725], "text": "Captain Steve Rogers"}, {"position": [738, 739], "text": "he"}, {"position": [747, 748], "text": "he"}, {"position": [768, 769], "text": "he"}, {"position": [772, 773], "text": "he"}, {"position": [809, 811], "text": "the man"}, {"position": [852, 853], "text": "him"}, {"position": [860, 862], "text": "the man"}, {"position": [888, 889], "text": "Steve"}, {"position": [894, 895], "text": "his"}, {"position": [899, 900], "text": "Steve"}, {"position": [916, 918], "text": "Steve Rogers"}, {"position": [942, 943], "text": "I"}, {"position": [949, 950], "text": "you"}, {"position": [951, 952], "text": "my"}, {"position": [966, 967], "text": "I"}, {"position": [982, 983], "text": "I"}, {"position": [998, 999], "text": "I"}], "name": "Steve"}]}
