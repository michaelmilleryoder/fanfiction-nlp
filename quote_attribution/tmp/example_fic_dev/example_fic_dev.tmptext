A second trip to the local healing clinic -LRB- a hairline fracture -- easily fixed -RRB- and an awkward explanation to his mom later , Midoriya Midoriya_'s is back at home and condemned from leaving the house -- regardless of whether or not he wants to test out his new abilities . 


But despite the house arrest , Midoriya Midoriya_'s ca n't help but smile . His Midoriya_'s mom seems pretty excited , too -- she witnessed his Midoriya_'s rock firsthand , and although she ca n't entirely grasp how it took Izuku Izuku fourteen years to figure out bending , she 's ecstatic for her son . 


She bustles around the house , pulling out ingredients from the pantry and trying to tap at her phone at the same time . 


`` Oh , I 'm so excited for you , Izuku Izuku ! Earthbending! Can you believe it ? I 'm going to make you a cake . And I 'll call your father -- oh ! He 'll be so surprised ! He might want to come back in when he has a free day to say congrats -- '' 


`` Mom . Mom -- thank you . I 'm happy you 're excited , too , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s interrupts , walking over and leaning on the kitchen counter . He Midoriya_'s smiles warmly . `` But seriously , you do n't have to make me Midoriya_'s a cake . I Midoriya_'s kind of just want to go to bed right now , I Midoriya_'s 'm beat . '' 


She blinks , then beams back at him Midoriya_'s . `` Oh , of course ! It 's been quite the day for you Midoriya_'s -- I should have figured you Midoriya_'s 'd want to sleep . '' 


She places her phone and rolling pin on the counter , shuffling over to her son . Standing on tiptoes , she deposits a kiss on Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s forehead . 


`` I 'm very proud of you , '' she says softly . `` You never gave up , did you ? '' 


He Midoriya_'s smiles , then shakes his Midoriya_'s head slowly . She holds his Midoriya_'s shoulders , tears beading at the corners of her eyes . 


He Midoriya_'s kisses her forehead in turn , then pulling away to walk towards his Midoriya_'s bedroom . 


`` Night , Mom . '' 


`` Goodnight , Izuku Izuku . '' 


The door closes behind him Midoriya_'s and he Midoriya_'s plops onto his Midoriya_'s bed , dwelling on what a day it 's been . 


How could his Midoriya_'s life have changed so much in 24 hours ? How could he Midoriya_'s have gone from a non-bending nobody to the avatar ? 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s flops backwards , and then the overwhelming nature of what comes next hits him Midoriya_'s . 


He Midoriya_'s needs to go back to_the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World to talk to All Might and figure out his Midoriya_'s plan , pronto . 


The only method he Midoriya_'s knows of is sleep -- when he Midoriya_'s falls asleep , he Midoriya_'s should be able to go there . 


So he Midoriya_'s tries . He Midoriya_'s lays on his Midoriya_'s bed , staring blankly at the ceiling . 


This should be easy -- he Midoriya_'s 's supposedly the bridge between the human world and the Spirit World , so he Midoriya_'s should be able to cross over with no problem . He Midoriya_'s just needs to focus , to try to meditate and cross that chasm . 


But as he Midoriya_'s gazes upwards and tries to clear his Midoriya_'s thoughts , muffled worries cloud his Midoriya_'s mind . 


Why was n't I able to bend up until now ? What 's wrong with me ? 


Who do I talk to ? I do n't know what to do and I ca n't contact my only source of advice . 


What if I ca n't get into Yuuei ? How will I master bending if I do n't go there -- will I have to leave home ? Without telling my mom ? 


The_Spirit_World The_Spirit_World slips from his The_Spirit_World grasp and he The_Spirit_World shifts to his The_Spirit_World side with a weary sigh , resigning himself The_Spirit_World to a restless sleep . 


x


There 's no school the next day and his The_Spirit_World mom leaves the house telling him The_Spirit_World to stay put and rest -- but the second she closes the door behind her , he The_Spirit_World pulls on a jacket and slides on his The_Spirit_World shoes . 


He The_Spirit_World 's not well , but he The_Spirit_World ca n't rest easy until he The_Spirit_World knows the full extent of his The_Spirit_World bending abilities . He The_Spirit_World has to see if he The_Spirit_World can bend more than just earth and air . 


Past the back lot and under the cover of trees , Midoriya Midoriya_'s comes to a stop . His Midoriya_'s head still has that cotton feeling that dulls his Midoriya_'s senses slightly , but overall he Midoriya_'s feels much more focused and refreshed . He Midoriya_'s uncaps a waterbottle and places it on the ground , then goes to stand five feet away . 


First up : waterbending . 


He Midoriya_'s mimics the movements he Midoriya_'s sees all the time on TV -- the back and forth , the pushing and pulling , the fluid arm circles . 


But the movements are too smooth , too gentle -- he Midoriya_'s ca n't figure out how to transfer his Midoriya_'s energy into the water without the powerful and decisive motions of earthbending . 


He Midoriya_'s tries for a couple more minutes , then drops the positioning with a sigh . 


Okay , now for the one he Midoriya_'s has even less hope with : firebending . 


It 's the same deal as waterbending ; he Midoriya_'s goes through the pro motions , sharp jabs and thrusts . But the sheer emotion equated with firebending , the power that those benders display -- Midoriya Midoriya_'s ca n't tap into it . 


Sure , he Midoriya_'s 's got fight in him Midoriya_'s . 


But he Midoriya_'s ca n't seem to draw it out in the form of fire . 


He Midoriya_'s treks back home , disappointed but not surprised . 


All that 's left to do now is to try to talk to All Might and get some answers . 


x


He Midoriya_'s tries for a week : meditating , deep breathing , music . Anything to relax and help him Midoriya_'s cross over . 


But nothing works . He Midoriya_'s always begins to think of his Midoriya_'s troubles , to worry about the path ahead . 


It 's a cycle -- his Midoriya_'s anxiety means he Midoriya_'s ca n't make it to the Spirit World , but not getting to the Spirit World is causing him Midoriya_'s even more anxiety . It 's excessively stupid and he Midoriya_'s knows that he Midoriya_'s needs to calm down , to let his Midoriya_'s worries go . 


But he Midoriya_'s ca n't . That 's not in his Midoriya_'s nature . 


It 's after another failed attempt that Midoriya Midoriya_'s hoists himself Midoriya_'s , blurry-eyed , from the bed . He Midoriya_'s goes to sit at his Midoriya_'s desk , head in his Midoriya_'s hands , staring at the wood grain below . 


He Midoriya_'s 's beginning to wonder if that whole thing with All_Might All_Might_'s was a fever dream , that he Midoriya_'s 's the avatar but he Midoriya_'s never actually had that discussion with his Midoriya_'s predecessor . 


Why is he Midoriya_'s so bad at this ? Was n't this supposed to come naturally ? 


He Midoriya_'s stares at the desk for another second , then raises his Midoriya_'s head . Reaching for his Midoriya_'s laptop , he Midoriya_'s flips it open and frantically types . 


avatar life biographies 


It 's a dumb Google search , he Midoriya_'s knows . But he Midoriya_'s needs to know that he Midoriya_'s 's not alone , that what he Midoriya_'s 's going through is normal . 


He Midoriya_'s clicks the first link and begins to read . 


An airbending avatar , 10 lifetimes back , that did n't master all the elements until she was 36 . A firebending avatar , 3 lifetimes ago , that struggled consistently with going into the Avatar State . Another earthbender , 8 lifetimes past , that avoided all other kinds of bending , finding them foreign and difficult . 


The story that comforts him Midoriya_'s the most is All_Might_'s All_Might_'s . 


`` Avatar_Toshinori Avatar_Toshinori was reportedly unable to visit the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World until he Avatar_Toshinori was eighteen , '' the article reads . `` When asked about the most difficult part of his Avatar_Toshinori journey to become a fully-realized avatar , he Avatar_Toshinori responded with : ` the spiritual aspect . ''' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s stares at the words , a faint smile creeping on his Midoriya_'s face . 


He Midoriya_'s 's not alone . He Midoriya_'s 's never been alone . His Midoriya_'s struggle has been going on for centuries , and he Midoriya_'s 's far from the first avatar to not know what to do . 


Even when a deep tiredness settles into his Midoriya_'s bones , he Midoriya_'s continues to scroll through his Midoriya_'s past lives . 


He Midoriya_'s feels connected . 


When he Midoriya_'s begins to doze off , cheek on the desk and eyes still on the computer , there 's something like a humming that leaks into his Midoriya_'s ears . He Midoriya_'s lets his Midoriya_'s eyes sink shut , and the humming overtakes him Midoriya_'s , filling his Midoriya_'s ears and sinking into his Midoriya_'s limbs . 


He Midoriya_'s lets it engulf him Midoriya_'s . 


x


He Midoriya_'s can sense the difference before his Midoriya_'s eyes even flick open . 


The air around him Midoriya_'s feels lighter , the ache of his Midoriya_'s limbs fading and the weight of his Midoriya_'s eyelids lessening . 


He Midoriya_'s blinks , taking in the familiar clearing and lush greenery . But a quick survey shows that the former avatar is nowhere to be seen . 


A sense of panic settles in his Midoriya_'s core . 


`` All_Might All_Might_'s ? '' he Midoriya_'s questions quietly . Only silence greets him Midoriya_'s . Then it hits him Midoriya_'s . 


It 's just silence -- no noise from the babbling stream or the insects from within the trees , like last time . Simply eerie quietness , thick and foreboding . 


Something 's wrong . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s whips around , suddenly growing paranoid that he Midoriya_'s 's being watched . The landscape seems to darken , the shadows in between trees growing blacker and the foliage taking on a gray tint . He Midoriya_'s nervously scans , trying to find the source of his Midoriya_'s unease . 


A wave of something hits him Midoriya_'s , grim and heavy . Gravity seems to grow exponentially stronger but he Midoriya_'s fights it , struggling to stay upright and standing . Then he Midoriya_'s sees it . 


Maybe it 's his Midoriya_'s imagination -- there 's shifting on a tree 15 feet to his Midoriya_'s left , almost a crawling motion , digits spidering their way across the trunk . Pale fingers ... 


A hand , but not attached to a body . 


He Midoriya_'s chokes back a muffled cry of horror , stumbling a step before turning and sprinting in the opposite direction . 


He Midoriya_'s runs from that evil aura , the emotions of hatred and vengeance and never-ending loneliness that threaten to swallow him Midoriya_'s whole . Midoriya Midoriya_'s is no expert on the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World , but he Midoriya_'s knows that that is not supposed to be there . He Midoriya_'s wheezes and weaves between trees , attempting to get away as fast as possible . 


The invading emotions slowly fade as he Midoriya_'s puts distance between him Midoriya_'s and the thing , to his Midoriya_'s relief . He Midoriya_'s slows down and leans against the thick trunk of a towering tree , trying to catch his Midoriya_'s breath . 


But a new sensation appears , less of a feeling and more of a magnetic pull . It 's the polar opposite of what he Midoriya_'s felt merely a few minutes ago : it 's hope , it 's reassurance and guidance . Midoriya Midoriya_'s straightens up , tiredly shuffling in what he Midoriya_'s thinks is the right direction . 


It is n't a far walk -- only about five minutes -- until he Midoriya_'s reaches the edge of the forest , the overhead canopy making way to purple blue sky and sloping green hills . Midoriya Midoriya_'s merely blinks slowly , until a voice calls his Midoriya_'s name somewhere to his Midoriya_'s left . 


He Midoriya_'s turns to see the former avatar , picking his Midoriya_'s way over tree roots towards him Midoriya_'s . 


Thank god . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s walks over to meet him Midoriya_'s , the man 's presence putting him Midoriya_'s at ease . 


`` You have n't been here in a while , my boy , '' All_Might All_Might_'s says , clapping Midoriya Midoriya_'s on the back like an old friend rather than some kid he 's only met once . `` Troubles getting back to the Spirit World ? '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s shrinks . `` Yes ... It took me Midoriya_'s a bit to figure out how to get here , but I Midoriya_'s think I Midoriya_'s 've got it now . '' 


`` I Midoriya_'s 'm glad -- I Midoriya_'s 've got a feeling that there would have been trouble , had you learned any later . '' 


The man gives him a small smile and a final back pat , then turning to sit on a raised tree root . He seems relaxed , nonchalant . 


But something in his words bother Midoriya Midoriya_'s . He hesitates , then asks . 


`` What do you Midoriya_'s mean by ` trouble ? ''' 


All_Might All_Might_'s freezes , like he 's been caught in some secret act . It All_Might_'s feels ... weird , pressing his childhood hero to share information with him , but Midoriya Midoriya_'s stays firm , fixing his mentor with a questioning stare . 


He has to familiarize himself with his past life . They have to be open with each other , and that connection starts with no secrets . 


Something in Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s look must tell All_Might All_Might_'s this ; he sighs . 


`` Well , I suppose you Midoriya_'s would 've learned sooner or later , anyhow , '' All_Might All_Might_'s says , scooching to the left and patting the root next to him . Midoriya Midoriya_'s pauses , then walks over to sit . 


There 's a moment of silence as All_Might All_Might_'s formulates what to say ; he fiddles those long fingers of his and stares straight ahead . Midoriya Midoriya_'s just watches his Midoriya_'s hands , letting the avatar think . 


The fingers stop promptly and Midoriya Midoriya_'s locks eyes with his mentor , now donning a grim expression . 


`` I 'll cut to the chase : something dark is on the horizon , '' All_Might All_Might_'s says , black eyes boring into Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s . `` For both your world and mine . '' 


`` What ... What is it ? '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s asks hesitantly . 


All_Might All_Might_'s sighs . `` I Midoriya_'s wish that I Midoriya_'s knew , my Midoriya_'s boy . '' 


`` Well , what makes you think that , then ? Have you been seeing something , had to fight someone ? '' 


All_Might All_Might_'s rises and stands in front of Midoriya Midoriya_'s , almost as if the very thought of evil on the horizon makes him restless . 


`` There 's a group -- a league , I should say -- that has been dabbling with affairs in both the human world and the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World . I 've spotted them a few times here , and some of my human correspondents in your realm have gotten glances , too . '' All Might scratches at the top of his head , staring off into the woods . `` They 're not sending people here so much as they are sending entities ... Always a cloud of dark mist or a hand ... '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s shudders and All_Might All_Might_'s stops . 


`` Midoriya Midoriya_'s ? Did you see one of them ? '' 


The boy fidgets . “Um, yes.” He fiddles with his fingers , looking down at the ground . `` I thought I spotted a hand ... It felt like it was watching me . . And it was radiating these awful emotions ... '' 


All Might mutters curses under his breath , stepping forward to place a hand on Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s shoulders . 


`` I 'm sorry you had to witness that , my boy . I would be lying if I told you I knew what that thing is up to -- but I can say this , '' he says , locking eyes with his successor . `` Do n't try to find out what it is . Not yet.” 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s breathes sharply . `` But , All Might -- '' 


`` You Midoriya_'s 're not ready to face off with whatever this is , '' he cuts Midoriya Midoriya_'s off . `` I Midoriya_'s understand you Midoriya_'s want to help , but for now the best thing you Midoriya_'s can do is lay low and train . You Midoriya_'s have a lot of missed time to make up for . '' 


He Midoriya_'s has a point -- what could Midoriya Midoriya_'s even do right now ? The boy slumps a little , the argument lost . 


`` Do n't worry , '' All_Might All_Might_'s says . `` It has n't done anything too villainous , as of yet . Plus , I All_Might_'s have contacts in the real world that are trying to find its source . We 'll know what it is , soon enough . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s tenses at `` contacts , '' recalling what he came here to ask about . `` Uh , All_Might All_Might_'s , about the real world ... '' 


`` You Midoriya_'s 're not sure what you Midoriya_'s 're supposed to be doing , right ? '' All_Might All_Might_'s responds . `` We 're connected -- I All_Might_'s can feel your Midoriya_'s confusion and apprehension towards the task at hand . '' 


The words stolen from his mouth , Midoriya Midoriya_'s freezes for a second , then nods weakly . He shrugs away from the avatar 's grasp , rising from his seat and starting a nervous pace . 


`` I do n't even know where to start , '' he mutters , hand on his chin as he walks back and forth . `` Do I just come out and announce it ... '' 


`` Midoriya Midoriya_'s . '' 


`` Or keep it quiet -- '' 


`` Breathe . '' 


`` Or just train in one element , or -- '' 


`` You 're overthinking this , my boy . '' 


`` But am I ? '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s frantically shoots back , stopping in his Midoriya_'s tracks . 


All_Might All_Might_'s pauses , then belts out a laugh . 


It 's contagious -- Midoriya Midoriya_'s ca n't help but crack into a smile , then a chuckle , and then a full laugh . 


They both laugh longer than the situation warrants , but when they finally stop , Midoriya Midoriya_'s feels more relaxed . Something about the avatar just calls for calm -- in the face of the daunting , he Midoriya_'s still manages to put on a smile . 


He Midoriya_'s was n't the `` most charismatic avatar '' for nothing , Midoriya Midoriya_'s guesses . 


`` I All_Might_'s 'm sorry to laugh , kid -- I All_Might_'s 'm just very happy to see you Midoriya_'s so serious about this , '' All_Might All_Might_'s says , seating himself again . `` Okay , back to business . You Midoriya_'s know the traditional path an avatar takes . '' 


`` Yes : you 're told of their role when you turn sixteen and then you embark on your journey to master the elements . You go in the order of the Avatar Cycle -- for me , that would be earth , fire , air , water , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s says . `` But I 've already diverged from all of that . '' 


`` True , '' the former avatar agrees . `` You 're making yourself out to be quite the nontraditional case . But that 's okay . Some of the best avatars of the past have strayed from the tradition and turned out perfectly fine . '' 


`` Yeah , but I bet all of them were able to bend before they turned fourteen , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s murmurs , earning a sad look from All_Might All_Might_'s . 


`` You ca n't dwell on that , Midoriya Midoriya_'s , '' the man says softly . `` You 're a unique case . '' 


`` What did you say it was -- that my energy was blocked ? '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s questions . `` How did it suddenly get unblocked ? Why was it blocked in the first place ? '' 


`` Like I said earlier -- it was a combination of different factors : emotional stunting , insecurity , et cetera , '' All_Might All_Might_'s replies , shifting on his perch . He scratches the top of his head , looking somewhere off into the landscape behind Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s shoulder . `` And -- er , this is n't for certain , but ... it may have also been my fault . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s tenses . “What?” 


The avatar sighs . `` My fight with All For One did n't just leave my body scarred . They tried to keep it from the public -- it would have sent everything into even more chaos , if they had -- but : there was a spiritual aspect to what the Rebellion was trying to accomplish , as well . 


`` All For One had two main goals : firstly , to gain control of Harmony Harmony and , by extent , all four nations . But their second , more ominous goal , was ... crazy . Theoretically impossible. Unless , that is , you had a stable bridge to take you back and forth from the Spirit World . '' 


`` He was interested in looking for bending energy sources in the Spirit World -- that is , places that could ` grant ' bending . I guess you could say he wanted to become a pseudo-avatar . '' 


It 's faint -- a slight hesitancy to All_Might_'s All_Might_'s words , a tiny pause that drops like lead into Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s stomach . 


Is he afraid ? 


In an instant , All_Might All_Might_'s suddenly seems so much smaller , so much more scared and lost and dead . 


Is this what 's in store for me , too ? Or will it be worse ? 


He shudders as All_Might All_Might_'s begins to speak again . 


`` Now , whether places like that actually exist is entirely beyond my knowledge -- or if I could even take people with me when crossing worlds , but ... All For One wanted me to bring him to the Spirit World , regardless . And he was going to do it by force . '' 


`` So ... you were n't just fighting to stop them from taking Harmony Harmony , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s says . `` You were fighting to avoid being captured , too . '' 


All_Might All_Might_'s nods . `` And what a fight it All_Might_'s was . It All_Might_'s took everything I had to hold him at bay . I 'm guessing you already know this , but I had to go into the_Avatar_State the_Avatar_State . No small feat , but it the_Avatar_State worked and I almost had him finished . But then I got hit . '' He grimaces at the memory , placing a hand over his concealed wound . `` I think that this was the first factor in blocking your energy . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s furrows his Midoriya_'s brow . `` But ... sustaining injuries in the_Avatar_State the_Avatar_State is n't enough to end the_Cycle the_Cycle . Or block energy . '' 


`` You 're right , the injury itself Midoriya_'s was n't what did it Midoriya_'s , '' the man replies , with a hint of ... embarrassment ? Shame ? `` But after taking that hit , I was ... I did n't know if I would win , and I did n't want to be the one to end the_Cycle the_Cycle . So I went out of the_State the_Avatar_State for the rest of the fight . '' 


A lightbulb goes off in Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s head . 


`` You were ashamed that you got scared for yourself , '' he states . `` And ashamed that you left the_State the_Avatar_State , even though staying in it the_Avatar_State could have ended the fight a lot sooner and saved more of the city . So you blocked a chakra point . '' 


All_Might All_Might_'s blinks . `` Er . Yes. It seems like you know something about chakras . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s flushes , waving his Midoriya_'s hands in apology . `` Oh , I 'm so sorry -- that was insensitive of me -- '' 


`` No , my boy , it 's fine . '' All_Might All_Might_'s gives him Midoriya_'s a small smile . `` Butting your Midoriya_'s head into other people 's business is the mark of a good avatar . And it 's good to see you Midoriya_'s already know about your Midoriya_'s chakras -- those are important . '' 


The blood does n't leave Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s face , and he Midoriya_'s squeaks out a thank you Midoriya_'s . 


`` So yes , like you Midoriya_'s said , '' All_Might All_Might_'s starts again slowly . `` I did n't resolve my own emotional issues in my lifetime , and ended up clogging my fire chakra -- willpower , blocked by shame . '' 


`` But why would that block all of my bending ? '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s questions . 


`` Well -- my theory is that I did n't just have one chakra clogged . '' The man raises his right hand and points an index finger at his forehead . `` Thought chakra . Pure cosmic energy , blocked by worldly attachments . And I passed on with a lot of people that I wanted to save and a lot of people I wanted to bring to justice . '' 


`` And you think that carried over into my chakras , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s concludes . 


`` I 'll say that I was never quite as good at the whole ` spiritual aspect ' as some of the former avatars . So I do n't know if my running theory actually works , '' All_Might All_Might_'s says . `` And while I 've come to terms with my fate and emotions , I had to fix the Thought Chakra in person -- but some sort of disconnect between us kept you from coming here for fourteen years . '' 


So that 's what the whole forehead thing was last time , Midoriya Midoriya_'s thinks . But what kind of disconnect ... 


`` But what 's important is that you 're here now and you 've already bended two elements , '' All_Might All_Might_'s says , interrupting Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s thoughts . `` You 've also attempted water and fire , correct ? '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s nods . `` But I was n't able to do either . I ca n't really figure out what I should be feeling when I bend those . '' 


`` Do n't rush it , '' All_Might All_Might_'s advises . `` You 've only just entered the bending world , so start with earth , move to air , and then attempt the other two . Every avatar has an element they struggle with -- mine was fire . '' He looks Midoriya Midoriya_'s up and down . `` And I feel like yours will be , as well . '' 


`` How can you tell ? '' 


All Might tents his hands , fingertips on his lips . `` You 'll find that most firebenders have found sources for their bending that are ... Self-destructive . Angry . Not the true essence of what firebending is intended to be . '' 


Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s brain spits out a mental picture of a snarling Kacchan , which he Midoriya_'s shoves down immediately . 


`` I Midoriya_'s feel as though you 've only ever witnessed that kind of firebending in your life . You might attempt to start off on the wrong foot , without the right master , '' he Midoriya_'s continues . `` And even then , it may take some time . The meanings of each element must be learned -- and as someone who 's always been on the receiving end of an angry firebender , its meaning might not come easy . '' 


The knowing look All_Might All_Might_'s gives Midoriya Midoriya_'s tells him Midoriya_'s that he Midoriya_'s knows all about Bakugou . Midoriya Midoriya_'s returns a nervous smile . 


`` It will take time of course . I know you want to have a step-by-step plan , something to follow to the letter . But you must remember : a large aspect of being the avatar is following the flow of energy . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s must look confused , because the former avatar sighs . 


`` The flow -- whether it be in your bending , in conflicts , in your own life . You must learn to adapt accordingly and make split second decisions for the good of mankind , '' All_Might All_Might_'s says . `` While I All_Might_'s am here to give you advice , I All_Might_'s am not always going to be there when you need to make tough choices in the spur of the moment . '' 


The boy already knew all that , but something about All Might saying it aloud makes it more real . 


`` Your hardships and battles will be different than mine All_Might_'s . You can not copy me All_Might_'s -- that 'll only end in tragedy . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s gazes up at his Midoriya_'s predecessor , the weight of his Midoriya_'s words settling on his Midoriya_'s shoulders . 


He Midoriya_'s can ask for guidance , but the final decisions will be up to him Midoriya_'s . 


He Midoriya_'s can save the world , but he Midoriya_'s might not be able to save himself Midoriya_'s . 


The nod of understanding he Midoriya_'s gives feels like the click of a lock on his Midoriya_'s heart . There 's no backing out ; his Midoriya_'s fate is intertwined with that of the world . 


All_Might All_Might_'s responds with a grim smile . 


`` So tell me All_Might_'s , '' the man says , rising and turning to thread his way into the shadows of the trees . Midoriya Midoriya_'s begins to follow , only to have the scenery around him flicker out like a lightbulb . He 's once again in that black void , nothing but him , darkness , and the boom of his mentor 's voice . 


`` What are you going to do ? '' 


He trains like hell . 


If he 's going to train under anyone , he needs to make sure that his bones do n't shatter first . 


His immediate goal : fortify his plans for the future , fortify his body , and fortify his mind . 


Step number one : build muscle , work on power output , and prep himself for the Yuuei Yuuei entrance exam . 


He 's been doing this for years -- fragmenting his long term goals into smaller ones , staving off the pressure of his future by compartmentalizing it . He 'll still have to save the world someday , but for now he just has to focus on getting into Yuuei Yuuei . 


As to why he 's so dead set on Yuuei Yuuei ... it 's less of a specific reason and more of a feeling . 


Simply put , it feels like fate . 


-LRB- Midoriya Midoriya_'s ca n't deny that All Might attending the school in his Midoriya_'s youth plays a big factor in the magnetism of the school . -RRB- 


But the abundance of masters teaching there , the interdisciplinary focus in the bending , the probable contacts All_Might All_Might_'s has there -- it seems like a place specifically founded to groom avatars . 


So Yuuei it is . 


His Midoriya_'s life becomes a collage of bending matches , gyms , and the quiet lot behind his Midoriya_'s house . Anywhere where no one will stop him Midoriya_'s from practicing . When he Midoriya_'s 's not in school , he Midoriya_'s 's sweating -- pulling up rocks , seeing which moves work for him Midoriya_'s and which ones do n't . 


The internet helps him Midoriya_'s more than he Midoriya_'s would like to admit . Step-by-step power position tutorials , workout regiments , bending match videos -- they 're abundant and easily accessible , and Midoriya Midoriya_'s finds himself Midoriya_'s compiling all of their combined knowledge together until he Midoriya_'s has a semblance of an actual workout schedule . 


x


There are two aspects to the Yuuei practical exam : power and combat . Midoriya Midoriya_'s can learn combat moves by himself Midoriya_'s by watching pro matches -- but the power portion might prove to be a challenge , without direction . 


He Midoriya_'s ca n't figure out how to increase his Midoriya_'s power . He Midoriya_'s has a set limit , but honestly , it 's not enough . 


But when your mentor was notoriously good at interdisciplinary bending and using all of his Midoriya_'s might in the fighting ring , it seems wasteful to just let that expertise slide . 


So Midoriya Midoriya_'s finds himself Midoriya_'s back in the Spirit World two weeks after their last encounter , luckily encountering no shadowy hands . 


He Midoriya_'s pitches his Midoriya_'s idea to All Might : teach Midoriya Midoriya_'s the motions and logistics of a power-maximizing earthbending move to help him Midoriya_'s pass the exam . 


The proposition brings a smile to All_Might_'s All_Might_'s face . He Midoriya_'s beams , then places a large hand on Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s head . 


`` Do n't worry , '' he Midoriya_'s assures . `` I Midoriya_'s have just the move in mind . '' 


x


It 's backbreaking work . Even sleep no longer offers a refuge , due to power sessions with All_Might All_Might_'s . 


School , combat training , power practice , repeat . The months fly by and Midoriya Midoriya_'s hardly notices . 


Of course there are moments when he doubts what he 's doing -- is Yuuei Yuuei actually worth this ? He 's the avatar -- ca n't he put off the hellish training until later ? He 's going to get a master no matter what , so why panic ? 


But as buzzes of the entrance exam begin to dance around the classroom , Midoriya Midoriya_'s is painfully reminded that this is him catching up . That what he 's doing right now is making up for fourteen years of inactivity , fourteen years of missed bending experience . 


If he wants to train with the best , he has to put himself on equal footing first -- his spiritual title does not give him to a free ride to Yuuei . 


So despite his doubts , despite his fatigue , he pushes forward . He sees results . 


He 's sturdier , in mind and in body . He has an artillery of combat actions at his disposal . He has an All Might specialty move , guaranteed to max his power output . 


When ten months are up and the exam looms over the horizon , Midoriya Midoriya_'s actually feels like he Midoriya_'s 's standing at the starting line . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s shuffles past the Yuuei Yuuei gates , his Midoriya_'s throat in his Midoriya_'s stomach and his Midoriya_'s legs trembling . 


He Midoriya_'s did okay on the written portion -- a lot of it was interdisciplinary bending logistics , the history of bending , and what-would-you-do scenarios . There were only one or two he Midoriya_'s did n't know at all , and a couple more he Midoriya_'s was hesitant about , but it seems likely he Midoriya_'s scored well . 


Now comes the tough part . 


He Midoriya_'s 's forcing himself Midoriya_'s to be calm , clasping his Midoriya_'s hands together to stop their shaking and taking deep , controlled breaths . He Midoriya_'s closes his Midoriya_'s eyes . 


The worst that can happen is he Midoriya_'s has to go to another bending school . He Midoriya_'s 's prepared for this . He Midoriya_'s 's done as much as he Midoriya_'s can . It 's all a matter of showing that work now . 


Slightly calmer , Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s eyes flick back open . A small smile creeps onto his Midoriya_'s face and he Midoriya_'s takes a big step forward -- 


Directly into a rock jutting out of the pavement . 


He Midoriya_'s topples but his Midoriya_'s mind stays strangely clear . 


Of course , his Midoriya_'s brain sighs , resigned to its fate . Of COURSE you have to fall and break your arm right before the biggest exam of your life . You would n't be Midoriya Izuku if you did n't pull some clutzy move like this . So stupid. 


Right before he Midoriya_'s gets a faceful of asphalt , however , there 's a whoosh and suddenly he Midoriya_'s is n't falling . 


In fact , he Midoriya_'s 's floating . 


Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s eyes go wide and he Midoriya_'s yelps , scrambling to get upright . The air begins to assist him Midoriya_'s upwards , bringing him Midoriya_'s from 20º to 90º . His Midoriya_'s feet firmly planted on the ground again , Midoriya Midoriya_'s turns to find his Midoriya_'s savior . 


`` Are you okay ? '' A short girl with a gravity-defying bob smiles worriedly at him Midoriya_'s , arms still raised from bending . Her big brown eyes look him Midoriya_'s up and down , questioning and caring . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s merely stares . 


`` Sorry for not asking before using my Midoriya_'s bending on you Midoriya_'s , '' she continues , shifting her hands to grasp the strap of the satchel at her hip . `` I Midoriya_'s figured it would be bad luck to trip before the exam ! '' 


She tilts her head and beams . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s feels himself Midoriya_'s nearly go into cardiac arrest . 


`` Uh , '' he Midoriya_'s eloquently responds . 


`` Well , we better get inside -- they 're starting soon . I 'm so nervous ! But let 's both do our best , okay ? '' 


`` Um , '' he Midoriya_'s tries again . 


`` Good luck ! '' she says , turning to continue her way across the courtyard . Only his Midoriya_'s eyes follow , watching the swish of her yellow skirt as she climbs the stairs and vanishes inside the building . 


He Midoriya_'s does n't think of how mortifying that was . He Midoriya_'s does n't think of how experienced the benders he Midoriya_'s 's up against must be , for that girl to pull such a controlled stunt with no prep . He Midoriya_'s does n't even think about the dreaded exam . 


His Midoriya_'s brain simply spits out : 


I talked to a girl ! 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s stands there , beaming like an idiot , until someone bumps into his Midoriya_'s shoulder . 


`` Get moving , shitty Deku , '' they growl . 


It pulls him Midoriya_'s out of his Midoriya_'s reverie ; he Midoriya_'s jumps at the sight of Kacchan 's red glare boring into him Midoriya_'s -- but is then subsequently confused when the other boy just keeps walking forward to the doors . 


No taunting . No teasing . Nothing . 


It 's true that Bakugou this_time_Bakugou had been a lot more reserved following the ... incident . Whereas previous help from Midoriya Midoriya_'s spurred on relentless insults , this_time_Bakugou this_time_Bakugou seemed recoil from any contact at all . Is he this_time_Bakugou ashamed ? Angry ? 


Either way , Midoriya Midoriya_'s finds that the lack of attention -- positive or negative -- is off-putting . It feels like Bakugou this_time_Bakugou is plotting something . 


-LRB- Or that Bakugou this_time_Bakugou thinks he this_time_Bakugou 's plotting something . -RRB- 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s tries to wipe that unease from his Midoriya_'s mind , changing his Midoriya_'s thoughts to the task ahead . He Midoriya_'s sighs , then follows his Midoriya_'s neighbor through those daunting doors . 


They 're greeted by a towering stage , the seats layered around it packed and chatter bouncing off the walls . A quick pitstop at the check-in table and the bestowing of the testing pack and seating assignments for the info session , then the two deposit themselves in chairs further back than Midoriya Midoriya_'s would like . 


The silence from Bakugou this_time_Bakugou is deafening ; they both quietly pin on their numbers and pull on their armbands , neither acknowledging the other 's presence . 


The air is thick with tension , awkward shifting in seats and nervous gazes drifting over the throng of other students as they all await the test instructions . Some stretch in place , some control their breathing , and some just sit and stare . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s finds himself Midoriya_'s in the last category , trying to push down the trembling in his Midoriya_'s stomach as he Midoriya_'s watches the experienced motions and sculpted muscles of the others around him Midoriya_'s . 


What was he Midoriya_'s thinking ? He Midoriya_'s literally only learned how to earthbend -- what , ten months ago ? These kids have been bending their whole lives . Who was he Midoriya_'s to think that he Midoriya_'s could waltz in as some amateur and actually procure himself Midoriya_'s a spot in the top bending school in the city ? 


Stupid, stupid, stupid. 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s nervously adjusts the green armband on his Midoriya_'s forearm -- an earthbender . Just an earthbender . 


He Midoriya_'s needs to keep it that way . 


If people find out that he Midoriya_'s 's the avatar , they also find out that All_Might All_Might_'s is dead . The fragile peace that All_Might_'s All_Might_'s image has upheld since the rebellion collapses , and he Midoriya_'s 's forced to deal with the aftermath -- untrained . Imagine the sheer panic that would arise when people found out their current avatar was n't even able to bend up until 10 months ago . 


He Midoriya_'s might consider telling some of the Yuuei Yuuei staff if he Midoriya_'s actually gets in -- some of them might already know , even -- , but it 's essential that he Midoriya_'s keep this secret until he Midoriya_'s 's mastered Earth at least . 


Of course , he Midoriya_'s has to get into Yuuei Yuuei first . 


His Midoriya_'s thoughts are interrupted when he Midoriya_'s notices what appears to be their instructor . 


A man in airbending reds and yellows takes to the stage , swaggering over to the podium and tapping at the mic a few times . He Midoriya_'s glances at some papers laid out in front of him Midoriya_'s , then looks up at the crowd of students ahead . He Midoriya_'s uses one hand to slick his Midoriya_'s pointy yellow hair back , and the other to read whatever is written on his Midoriya_'s notes . 


When he Midoriya_'s 's done , he Midoriya_'s looks up , smiles , and then shouts . 


`` HOW 'S IT GOIN ' , PROSPECTIVE YUUEI STUDENTS ? '' 


The students all slam their hands over their ears , the mic turned up way too high for someone who is obviously naturally pretty loud . 


The_man Midoriya_'s glances at someone at the back of the stage , pulling his Midoriya_'s mouth away from the mic . 


`` What -- you want me to ? '' He Midoriya_'s gestures at the mic , then at himself Midoriya_'s . More gesticulating , then a look of understanding . `` Oh , you want me to not use the mic ? Okay , that 's cool . That 's fair . '' 


He Midoriya_'s steps away from the podium , then starts again . 


`` Sorry for that . Good morning , examinees ! I hope you 're ready to TEST ! '' 


Midoriya Midoriya gasps with recognition , clapping a hand over his Midoriya mouth . 


`` That 's -- that 's Yamada Hizashi ! Present Mic ! '' he Midoriya whispers excitedly . `` Bending match announcer and pro airbender for the -- '' 


`` Stop fangirling and fucking pay attention , dipshit , '' Bakugou this_time_Bakugou growls . Midoriya Midoriya_'s shuts up instantly , but a smile still tugs at the corners of his Midoriya_'s mouth . 


`` Let 's get right to it ! As you all know , Yuuei Yuuei is a multi-disciplinary combat school with a focus on bending and fighting 's active use in careers , '' Yamada Yamada says , gesturing at the Jumbotron behind him Midoriya as it blinks from the school logo to the number 2 . He Midoriya , in turn , raises two fingers . `` That 's why we 'll be testing you on two different aspects : power and combat . '' 


# 1 , the jumbotron reads . Power . 


`` First , we have to gage how much power you can put into your bending , '' Yamada Yamada explains . `` We need to have you at a certain caliber of bending before we can do any work with you . Airbenders will go for speed , firebenders for distance and heat , waterbenders for distance , and earthbenders for height . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s looks down at the table in front of him Midoriya_'s . Yeah , he Midoriya_'s 's been working on his Midoriya_'s power output through his Midoriya_'s sessions with All_Might All_Might_'s , but he Midoriya_'s is n't sure how that will stack up against the other benders here . He Midoriya_'s 'll just have to do his Midoriya_'s best . 


`` Remember : power comes from many different sources in bending , '' Yamada Yamada says , almost as a side-note . `` There 's sheer power , there 's technical power -- we do n't care whichever one you use , as long as your output is good . '' 


# 2 : Combat . 


`` And here 's the fun part -- the combat , '' the_man Midoriya_'s says with a devious grin . Midoriya Midoriya_'s gulps . 


`` We have multiple bending rings set up , each with their own stationed team , '' Yamada Yamada says , waving a hand at an animated fighting ring behind him Midoriya_'s . `` We 've assigned you into teams of four . Your task is simple : beat the other team . '' 


A murmur goes across the room , students glancing at one another . 


`` Now , just beating the other team is n't gon na be enough to pass , of course . We 're grading you on a multitude of other things . But I 'll tell you this : the more hits you get on the other team , the better . You do n't want to be a bystander for this test . '' 


`` You 'll get more info on the combat portion right before you fight , '' Yamada Yamada says . `` But for now : go show us some power ! '' 


His following wink rallies the students ; there 's a burst in noise from the crowd , with students vying to escape their seats and get to the testing sites first . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s follows hesitantly behind them , the reality of his Midoriya_'s competition now dawning on him Midoriya_'s . 


x


They 're broken into groups and taken down to different testing sites . He Midoriya_'s and Bakugou this_time_Bakugou are separated -LRB- thank god -RRB- , and he Midoriya_'s does n't bother mingling with the other examinees as they walk out onto the field -- he Midoriya_'s does n't think his Midoriya_'s stomach could take it . 


It 's a typical green field , but with a painted white line differentiating the testing zone from the observation zone . The students amass right on the line . 


He Midoriya_'s edges his Midoriya_'s way to the front of the crowd , opting to fight his Midoriya_'s nervousness by observing other students ' tests . As he Midoriya_'s waits for the test to begin , someone chimes right next to him Midoriya_'s . 


`` You Midoriya_'s made it ! '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s looks to his Midoriya_'s left to see his Midoriya_'s savior from earlier : the airbending girl . Somehow , they ended up in the same testing group -- Midoriya Midoriya_'s is n't sure whether he Midoriya_'s 's happy or sad about that . He Midoriya_'s fidgets . 


`` U-uh . Yep ... '' 


She looks a little more serious from earlier , the smile she returns not making it all the way to her eyes . She must be nervous , too . 


`` Well , good luck ! '' Without another word , she goes back to watching the field . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s is grateful for her not wanting to small-talk -- he Midoriya_'s would puke . 


The_proctor the_proctor makes his the_proctor way into the testing zone , scanning a clipboard . `` All right , '' he the_proctor begins . `` First , students here based on recommendation . Line up . '' 


A group of six students step forward , their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band . 


They represent all four elements , but they all have an air of confidence around themselves -- majority of them are guaranteed a spot at the school , whether it be due to money , ability , or both . 


Whereas Midoriya Midoriya_'s had to fight just to stand at the starting line with everyone else , these people are already leagues ahead of him Midoriya_'s . 


Their following displays are appropriately fantastic : a girl launches a water whip at break-neck speeds , some boy forces a column of rock at least three stories high . 


But the test that catches everyone 's attention is a boy with strange white and red hair . 


As he Midoriya_'s takes to the field , something about him Midoriya_'s seems familiar -- his Midoriya_'s hair ? The dignity he Midoriya_'s carries himself Midoriya_'s with ? Midoriya Midoriya_'s ca n't see his Midoriya_'s face , but he Midoriya_'s knows he Midoriya_'s 's seen this kid before . 


The_examinee Midoriya_'s seems to have tuned the rest of the world out . As soon as he Midoriya_'s 's given the go ahead , he Midoriya_'s swirls his Midoriya_'s arms in a loose circle , wrists twisting and elegantly pulling and pushing . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s ca n't help but be entranced by the display ; they 're the moves of an experienced waterbender , but something looks off -- instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending , the motions look borderline angry , fast and sometimes even jagged . 


The boy 's palms spark . 


With a sharp jump and thrust , a jet of flames erupts from his hands , leaving a charred line of grass half a football field long . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s flinches . 


His eyes finally drift down to the boy 's armband : red . Fire Nation . But what kind of bending was that ? It was more waterbending than firebending -- and in a test where you 're try to maximize power output , you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique . 


The boy looks unfazed , merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression . It 's not until he turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya Midoriya_'s spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his left eye and things click together . 


A scar . Strangely colored hair . Calm , removed . Firebending that looks like waterbending . 


That 's ... . 


That 's ... . 


`` Hey , um , '' the airbender girl says from beside him . `` You 're kind of staring . At Todoroki Shouto . Y’ know . The Firelord 's son . The one that hates staring . '' 


At the sound of his name , the prince turns and locks eyes with him . Midoriya Midoriya_'s snaps out of his Midoriya_'s trance , jerking to attention and whipping his Midoriya_'s head to the side in a TOTALLY subtle attempt to play it off . 


`` W-was I ? '' he Midoriya_'s nervously asks , eyes jumping across the backs of other testers , at the buildings -- anywhere but Todoroki Todoroki_'s . `` Haha , oops ... '' 


The girl starts laughing , to which a nearby boy almost immediately chimes in to tell her that laughing during an exam is disrespectful , and she ought to be ashamed , and if she aims to be a top bender , she should be paying extremely close attention , and a million other things that Midoriya tunes out . When he Midoriya_'s gages it 's been long enough , he Midoriya_'s shyly peeks at the prince again . 


Todoroki_'s Todoroki_'s mismatched eyes are still trained on him Midoriya_'s , the quiet intensity of his Midoriya_'s gaze making Midoriya Midoriya_'s fidget . It feels like he Midoriya_'s 's being analyzed -- like this boy is sinking under his Midoriya_'s skin and paging through his Midoriya_'s weaknesses and secrets . 


It 's scary . 


The prince finally looks away and Midoriya Midoriya_'s releases a breath he Midoriya_'s did n't know he Midoriya_'s was holding . 


`` Can I go ? '' Todoroki Todoroki_'s asks , turning to the test proctor . `` I Todoroki_'s 've done my Todoroki_'s required testing . '' 


`` I Todoroki_'s 'm afraid not , Your Highness , '' the_proctor the_proctor says . `` You have to stay here until all examinees have finished the power gaging portion of the exam . I the_proctor 'm sorry for all the formalities , but -- well , rules are rules . '' 


Todoroki Todoroki_'s sighs , then calmly moves his way off the testing lawn and into the crowd . He accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line , a buzzcut-headed airbender , but does n't apologize and keeps moving . The airbender side-eyes him before stepping up to test . 


The prince looks robotic . Icy . Not anything like what would be expected of the Firelord 's son . 


What happened to him ? What must his home life be like , to make him that cold ? 


But Midoriya Midoriya_'s is brought back to his Midoriya_'s current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field , ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes . Oh, right. He Midoriya_'s has to go up against that . 


He Midoriya_'s twitches in place as the_proctor the_proctor tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd . 


`` That concludes the recommendee testing , '' the_proctor the_proctor says . `` Now we 'll move on to standard testing -- and I the_proctor must remind recommendees that they 're to stay put for this portion , as well . '' He Midoriya_'s glances at Todoroki , who has melted somewhere into the back of the crowd . 


`` Everyone , please section off into your respective elements . '' 


With a shy smile , he Midoriya_'s and the airbending girls part ways . The_proctor the_proctor announces the order of elements : water , earth , fire , air . 


The following displays are n't as intimidating as the recommendees ' , but they still put Midoriya Midoriya_'s on edge . The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies , nonchalantly blasting streams across the field . 


When they move onto earthbending , Midoriya Midoriya_'s starts feeling intimidated . 


Yes , Midoriya Midoriya_'s has put on weight and packed on muscle . But he 's still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he sees on his fellow earthbenders . Sculpted calves , broad backs , and flat pecs -- Midoriya Midoriya_'s feels like he accidentally signed up for a bodybuilding show that he was horribly unprepared for . 


But All_Might_'s All_Might_'s advice comes to mind . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s , there 's a misconception about earthbending that you Midoriya_'s 're fixated on , he remembers All Might telling him one session when he was getting particularly frustrated with the move . 


Know this : muscle mass does not equate to power . 


No , power in bending comes from the strength of your Midoriya_'s own internal energy -- your Midoriya_'s body must be able to hold that power , of course , but your Midoriya_'s main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you Midoriya_'s push it into the elements . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s breathes deeply . Focus on himself Midoriya_'s . Focus on doing the move right . He Midoriya_'s almost does n't notice the test in front of him Midoriya_'s has finished . 


The_proctor the_proctor pauses for a moment before reading the next name . 


`` Midoriya Midoriya_'s Izuku . '' 


He Midoriya_'s jumps at the sound of his Midoriya_'s name , then begins to edge his Midoriya_'s way through the crowd with slumped shoulders . 


The prolonged look the_proctor the_proctor gives him Midoriya_'s feels too significant to ignore -- does he Midoriya_'s knows ? Does everyone in Yuuei know ? He Midoriya_'s swallows hard , then assumes his Midoriya_'s power stance . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s gazes down at his Midoriya_'s hands , trying to calm his Midoriya_'s heartbeat and praying he Midoriya_'s 's not about to do something that is n't earthbending . 


`` Whenever you 're ready , Midoriya Midoriya_'s , '' the_proctor the_proctor says , making the boy flinch . 


Okay , Midoriya Midoriya_'s : remember your training . You worked with All_Might All_Might_'s on this -- you should have this in the bag . He Midoriya_'s shifts , steadying his Midoriya_'s feet and shifting his Midoriya_'s weight into his Midoriya_'s heels . This is the easy part . 


A deep breath . 


Then he Midoriya_'s begins . 


The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending -- in a slow and deliberate movement , Midoriya Midoriya_'s moves his Midoriya_'s arms upwards from his Midoriya_'s core and out in a circle . His Midoriya_'s hands meet at the top ; he Midoriya_'s calmly lowers them , clasped over his Midoriya_'s heart . 


Draw power from your core , he Midoriya_'s hears All Might say . Bring your heart 's energy into your hands , then out through your feet and into the ground . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s imagines that energy transfer , sees his Midoriya_'s power bleed out of his Midoriya_'s chest and into his Midoriya_'s hands . 


Down and steady , my boy . 


His Midoriya_'s hands move lower towards the ground , dragging the energy into the earth below . 


And… Now! 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s thrusts his Midoriya_'s hands skyward in a singular decisive movement , the ground following the motion . He Midoriya_'s holds it , waits for the rumbling above to halt . And then he Midoriya_'s breaks stance , oddly drained after the display . 


He Midoriya_'s cranes his Midoriya_'s head upwards , panting . It rivals the earthbending he Midoriya_'s 's seen thus far -- it might even be higher . 


But the important thing is that he Midoriya_'s actually did it . 


He Midoriya_'s actually correctly did the move All_Might All_Might_'s taught him Midoriya_'s . 


He Midoriya_'s exits the bending zone with a small smile on his Midoriya_'s face , bubbling with internal pride . It makes him Midoriya_'s feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam -- at least he Midoriya_'s performed well on one half of the practical . He Midoriya_'s settles into the crowd , content to silently watch the next bending feats . 


“Hey.” 


It 's a hollow voice , cool and controlled . Midoriya Midoriya_'s turns to look at the speaker , ready to greet them in turn . 


He Midoriya_'s flinches when he Midoriya_'s sees it 's none other than the Fire Nation Prince , Todoroki_Shouto Todoroki_Shouto . 


-LRB- Is he Midoriya_'s supposed to bow ? Prostrate on the floor and kiss his Midoriya_'s shoes ? Oh god what is he Midoriya_'s supposed to do . -RRB- 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s instead opts to blink at the other boy , lost for words . Todoroki Todoroki_'s must be used to awed silence -- he Midoriya_'s speaks in Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s stead . 


`` That was an All Might specialty move , '' the prince states , unwavering . 


“Um. Y-yes ? '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s says . 


Todoroki Todoroki_'s does nothing but continue to stare and Midoriya Midoriya_'s mentally slaps himself for forgetting . 


`` Oh god , I mean -- yes , Your Highness , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s backtracks , face suddenly hot and palms uncomfortably sweaty . `` I admired -- '' 


`` Do n't call me that , '' Todoroki Todoroki_'s objects . “Please. I ca n't stand it when people associate me with my jerk of a father . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s reels at the nonchalant insult -- of course , there were rumors that the heir did n't get along with the_Firelord the_Firelord , but to be so open about it the_Firelord ... . 


Todoroki_Shouto Todoroki_Shouto must truly not care about family image . 


“Okay…. Todoroki Todoroki_'s , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s stammers . `` But , um , yes , I admired All_Might All_Might_'s a lot as a kid , and I picked up a lot of his bending tricks from watching his matches . '' 


`` That one stunt combines aspects of firebending with a basic earthbending move in order to amplify power output , '' Todoroki Todoroki_'s says without missing a beat . `` It 's supposed to take years to master -- they say you can only learn it at Yuuei or from All Might himself . '' 


Is it hot out here ? Or is it just Midoriya Midoriya_'s ? God , it 's boiling . 


Haha , I 'm so dead . 


`` I. Well . Hm , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s stammers , pulling at his Midoriya_'s collar and cringing under Todoroki_'s Todoroki_'s steady gaze . `` I Midoriya_'s guess ... I Midoriya_'s 'm just a quick learner ? '' 


Todoroki Todoroki_'s does n't move and Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s eyes flick around the surrounding crowd , desperately avoiding eye contact . The sensation of his Midoriya_'s skin being peeled back by the prince 's gaze has now amplified into the feeling of his Midoriya_'s skin being flayed . It takes all of his Midoriya_'s willpower to avoid scampering off . 


`` ... Sure , '' Todoroki Todoroki_'s says finally in the voice of someone utterly unconvinced . He Midoriya_'s scans Midoriya Midoriya_'s one more time , then turns without comment and walks back into the crowd . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s resists the urge to start hyperventilating . 


He Midoriya_'s gets the sense that he Midoriya_'s just had a very close call , even though there 's no way in hell that Todoroki Todoroki_'s could have known anything about some common Earth Kingdom kid like him Midoriya_'s . It was the sheer speculative power of the prince alone that nearly blew his cover -- that , and Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s horrendous ability to keep secrets . 


If he Midoriya_'s actually gets into Yuuei Yuuei , he Midoriya_'s 'll have to watch himself Midoriya_'s around the heir . 


He Midoriya_'s watches the rest of the examinees in a daze . It 's one amazing performance after the next -- they blend together in his Midoriya_'s mind and he Midoriya_'s finds himself Midoriya_'s both intimidated and inspired . 


This is what he Midoriya_'s could be if he Midoriya_'s gets into Yuuei Yuuei . 


This is the power he Midoriya_'s could practice beside , the people he Midoriya_'s could befriend . 


-LRB- He Midoriya_'s tries to ignore the sensation of mismatched , suspicious eyes attached to his Midoriya_'s back . -RRB- 


When the final test is complete , the_proctor the_proctor calls for them to gather into their respective elemental groups and to head inside -- further instructions will be provided there . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s leaves the field , a sense of foreboding lodging itself in his Midoriya_'s stomach . 


x


When he Midoriya_'s finds out the second portion of the match involves them wearing pro-bending uniforms , it 's simultaneously a nightmare and a dream-come-true . 


He Midoriya_'s stands in front of the strewn out clothes , knowing he Midoriya_'s needs to dress fast but taking his Midoriya_'s time regardless . How many times has he Midoriya_'s wanted to do this ? To wear these uniforms , to fight in the pro-bending ring ? 


But he Midoriya_'s finds he Midoriya_'s ca n't get any pleasure from it right now -- the stakes are too high . 


The rules of the match echo through his Midoriya_'s head as he Midoriya_'s pulls off his Midoriya_'s own sweats and picks up the black shirt and pants . 


`` This wo n't be your normal pro-bending match , with rounds and territory gains , '' Yamada shares , seated backwards in a chair in the small classroom . He Midoriya_'s looks far too casual for something that will make or break Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s future . 


`` Instead , it 's one 5-minute round , with your sole objective being to push the other team off the back . '' 


The padded underclothes are tight and restrictive ; Midoriya Midoriya_'s yanks them on and wishes he Midoriya_'s had asked for a size up . He Midoriya_'s 's grown more than he Midoriya_'s thought he Midoriya_'s had . 


`` The bare minimum to pass is KO'ing the other team . Individual scoring is based on how many hits on your opponents you each make . '' 


He Midoriya_'s shrugs the thick padding on over his Midoriya_'s shoulders , yanks the green sash around his Midoriya_'s waist tighter , and deposits the helmet on his Midoriya_'s head . He Midoriya_'s exits the room , swerving a left and going to the entry hall . 


`` You 'll want to keep as many of your teammates in the ring as you can , while also getting in as many hits on the enemy as possible . '' 


The lights of the arena are blinding ; he Midoriya_'s squints as he Midoriya_'s stumbles his Midoriya_'s way into the ring . He Midoriya_'s pays no mind to his Midoriya_'s teammates , solely focused on calming himself Midoriya_'s down before the match . 


`` If you fall out of the ring , you fail . '' 


He Midoriya_'s closes his Midoriya_'s eyes and inhales deeply . This is it . 


Some voice in the back of his Midoriya_'s head prompts him Midoriya_'s to wonder how Bakugou Bakugou_he_'s_thinking_about is faring in all of this -- but considering this is Bakugou_he_'s_thinking_about Bakugou_he_'s_thinking_about he Midoriya_'s 's thinking about , there 's no reason to be worried . 


He Midoriya_'s needs to focus on himself Midoriya_'s . 


“Hi again!” 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s jumps at the cheery voice interrupting his Midoriya_'s thoughts , then flushes when he Midoriya_'s spots the speaker : pixie bob girl . 


`` Looks like we 're on the same team , huh ? '' she notes , eyes skimming over Midoriya Midoriya_'s , then the other two team members behind him Midoriya_'s . `` The other two do n't seem to be terribly friendly . The waterbender glared at me when I tried to talk to him Midoriya_'s and the firebender was a little zoned out . I do n't think they 're into the whole teamwork thing , y’ know ? '' 


`` Uh-huyeah , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s says , internally slapping himself Midoriya_'s for the mix of gibberish he Midoriya_'s ca n't help but spew . 


Luckily , the girl does n't seem to mind . Maybe she 's used to it . `` Oh well , I guess we 'll just have to watch each others ' backs . I 'm Uraraka Uraraka_'s , by the way ! '' 


Uraraka Uraraka_'s : bright , beautiful . How fitting. 


`` M-Midoriya , '' he Midoriya_'s replies . 


`` Nice to meet ya , Midoriya Midoriya_'s ! '' She drops her helmet on her head , gives him Midoriya_'s a final smile and thumbs up , then paces ahead of him Midoriya_'s to the middle line . 


Well , at least that 's one advantage . Uraraka Uraraka_'s seems to be a pretty experienced bender -- even if airbending is n't terribly offensive , she 'll still cover for him Uraraka_'s . 


It 's a small comfort but a comfort nonetheless ; he Uraraka_'s joins his Uraraka_'s team at the start point . 


The following information the referee spits out sound like meaningless garble in his ears . Not that it matters -- he already knows the rules by heart . Instead , he takes the time to focus himself , to peek glances at his opponents and teammates . 


The other team is just as terrifying as he anticipated . He 's not sure if they 're Yuuei students or hired benders , but they 're older and hardened . They look sure of themselves and their bending , and face the prospective students with countenances of grim determination . 


His team is ... not quite so confident . Like Uraraka Uraraka_'s said , the firebender looks dazed and confused . The waterbender looks near murderous . 


But the face that scares him the most is Uraraka_'s Uraraka_'s . Gone is her Uraraka_'s cheery disposition and airy smile ; instead , all he sees is icy willpower . Her Uraraka_'s eyes pick apart the other team as well , dancing over their arms and legs and gauging their faces . 


This girl means business . 


Rather than put him at ease , it disorients him further -- he 's not the only one desperate to get in here . Is sabotage an option in this match ? What if she Uraraka_'s steals points from him ? 


Quit it , quit it , quit it ! He scolds himself internally , too lost in thought to notice the teams slowly edging towards their back boundaries and the ref raising a pointed hand . 


There 's literally no logic in Uraraka Uraraka_'s trying to beat you ! You 're on the same team , you both have to survive ! Regardless , you 'll get enough points anyway , you 've done the work and -- 


`` -- riya ! '' 


He startles , whipping around to see Uraraka Uraraka_'s shouting at him . 


`` They 're about to start ! '' 


He stumbles into Zone_1 Zone_1 and tries to sink into fighting position when a sharp voice booms overhead . Midoriya Midoriya_'s looks upwards , pupils shrinking in shock . 


`` ... 2 , 1 : GO . '' 


He does n't even have time to blink before something solid thumps into his stomach , sending him tumbling backwards and into Zone_2 Zone_2 . He wheezes a curse under his breath and then hauls himself to his feet , scanning the scene ahead . 


The match can only have been going on for ten seconds , but it 's already sheer chaos . The arena is a multitude of one-on-one battles : his waterbender is trying to get a blow on the opposing airbender , their firebender is being relentlessly pelted with stone disks -- she 's already in Zone 3 , yikes -- , and Uraraka Uraraka_'s is cartwheeling across Zone_1 Zone_1 to avoid fire blasts . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s raises a disk and angles it to hit the enemy earthbender , but then he Midoriya_'s realizes . 


Wait. 


... Where 's their waterbender ? 


The answer comes with a jet of water to the stomach . He Midoriya_'s lands on his Midoriya_'s butt but then uses his Midoriya_'s ground contact to his Midoriya_'s advantage , shooting out energy through the floor and calling for a nearby stone disk . The disk soars to his Midoriya_'s hands , which he Midoriya_'s then wields as a makeshift shield against the water strikes . The gaping hole in the middle means it does n't offer as much protection as he Midoriya_'s 'd like , but it 's all that he Midoriya_'s 's got . 


The blasts come in one-second intervals and with all the force of a train ; he Midoriya_'s peeks from around the side of his Midoriya_'s blockade to see the waterbender , at the edge of his Midoriya_'s Zone 1 and with firmly planted feet . 


Okay -- he Midoriya_'s has to somehow distract the waterbender to keep from getting blasted , then aim a disk at him Midoriya_'s to score a point . But how? 


His Midoriya_'s eyes leap across the field , settling on the duel between his Midoriya_'s team 's waterbender and the enemy airbender . That fight is almost over -- one more hit on the airbender and she 'll be off the back . 


Time for a risk . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s waits for a water-free moment , then flings his Midoriya_'s shield as hard as possible at the airbender . 


It does n't connect , but it disorients her ; taking advantage of the distraction , his Midoriya_'s team 's waterbender propels a column of water towards the enemy that hits her dead-on . She soars to the back of the arena and over the edge . 


Nice. One enemy down and one teammate free to assist . 


He Midoriya_'s gets pelted with water again -- but with nothing free to block it , the force pushes him Midoriya_'s uncomfortably close to the Zone 3 line . Gritting his Midoriya_'s teeth , he Midoriya_'s leans into the stream so he Midoriya_'s 's on his Midoriya_'s hands and knees . 


As soon as the water lets up , he Midoriya_'s leaps upright , stomping the ground and summoning another disk from the ground . He Midoriya_'s 'll have to make this fast . 


He Midoriya_'s keeps up the disk 's momentum with his Midoriya_'s arms , flinging the rock and his Midoriya_'s energy directly at the waterbender , poised for a direct hit and his Midoriya_'s first point -- 


Water makes it to the enemy first , slamming into him Midoriya_'s and pushing him Midoriya_'s into Zone_2 Zone_2 . Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s disk whizzes overhead and out of the ring . Midoriya Midoriya_'s drops his Midoriya_'s arms and cranes his Midoriya_'s head to look at the water 's source . 


His Midoriya_'s teammate , wheeling his Midoriya_'s arms and prepping another water blast , does n't even look at him Midoriya_'s as he Midoriya_'s shoots the enemy waterbender off the back and out of the ring . So much for teamwork . 


-LRB- They only have two enemies left now , but Midoriya Midoriya_'s finds he Midoriya_'s ca n't be happy about it . -RRB- 


A glance at the clock : 2 minutes left . 


Holy crap , only two minutes left already ? He Midoriya_'s still does n't have any points ! Who’s even left to hit? 


Their firebender must have been knocked out -- she 's nowhere to be seen . But the odds are still in their favor : three versus two . 


Uraraka Uraraka_'s is now engaged with the earthbender -- she 's struggling , but she 's staying put in Zone_1 Zone_1 . The firebender stands in the middle of Zone_2 Zone_2 , looking to pick a fight . 


Okay , there 's Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s target . 


The firebender , however , notices him Midoriya_'s first : she volleys off a round of fireballs right at him Midoriya_'s . He Midoriya_'s 's forced to roll to the side . He Midoriya_'s pushes onto his Midoriya_'s feet and breaks into a run when the fire keeps coming . 


He Midoriya_'s 's only done defense so far -- but what else can he Midoriya_'s do ? How can he Midoriya_'s fight when the_enemy Midoriya_'s wo n't even let him Midoriya_'s plant himself Midoriya_'s and utilize his Midoriya_'s bending ? 


Nearing the edge of the Zone 2 and Uraraka_'s Uraraka_'s fight , he Midoriya_'s has no choice but to turn around and backtrack -- he Midoriya_'s 's going to get hit . 


Unless he Midoriya_'s gets a distraction ... . 


“Uraraka!” Midoriya Midoriya_'s shouts , praying that she 'll be able to spare a moment . `` Some air , please ! '' 


She jerks at her name , looking towards Midoriya Midoriya_'s and narrowly sidestepping an oncoming earth disk from her opponent . Her gaze jumps over his Midoriya_'s fight , and then a spark of understanding leaps into her eyes . She nods . 


Whole arms twisting in a full-body circle , she inhales deeply and holds . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s shifts his Midoriya_'s core to head back in the direction he Midoriya_'s came from . 


Uraraka Uraraka_'s exhales and hell breaks loose . 


Something resembling a tornado erupts from her , spiraling towards the enemy firebender and redirecting her fireballs into a now fiery vortex . Eyes wide under her helmet , the opponent runs into Zone_3 Zone_3 to dodge it Zone_3 . 


Now! Now Midoriya Midoriya_'s can go for the hit . He Midoriya_'s plants himself Midoriya_'s , raising a disk . 


But before he Midoriya_'s can even aim it Zone_3 , the wind catches up to the firebender . She soars upwards , then off the edge and into the watery pit below along with the tornado . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s stares , desperation clawing at his Midoriya_'s core . 


`` One hit ! '' he Midoriya_'s cries in frustration . `` I Midoriya_'s just need one hit ! '' 


He Midoriya_'s looks dully at the scene ahead -- there 's just one more person to score hits on , and Uraraka Uraraka_'s seems to have that fight on lock . Or maybe the waterbender will try to snatch points from him Midoriya_'s again , if he Midoriya_'s 's still here . 


Turning around , however , the waterbender is nowhere to be found . It looks like it 's just him Midoriya_'s and Uraraka Uraraka_'s . But she 's more than capable -- if he Midoriya_'s tried to interfere , he Midoriya_'s 'd probably just mess her up . 


There 's a dull thud and someone yelps . Midoriya Midoriya_'s whips around to see Uraraka Uraraka_'s pinned under an earth disk , the opposing team 's earthbender stalking over . He Midoriya_'s gives a harsh stomp and a disk slides under his Midoriya_'s captive , the sharp motion making her wheeze . 


Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s eyes flit over to the clock : 30 seconds . 30 seconds until they win . 


However , if Uraraka Uraraka_'s gets knocked out of the ring and it 's just him Uraraka_'s and this other guy left ... Then they have to face off in a tiebreaker . 


Which , yes , is an opportunity for actual points , if Midoriya Midoriya_'s wins . 


But it also means that Uraraka Uraraka_'s fails . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s thrusts his Midoriya_'s hands upwards and raises a disk from the ground . He Midoriya_'s repeats the motion again , and again , and again until he Midoriya_'s has a 10-foot stack of disks hovering directly in front of him Midoriya_'s . He Midoriya_'s grunts under the strain , legs screaming in protest , but he Midoriya_'s manages to stay upright . 


Meanwhile , the_enemy Midoriya_'s is in position , arms pushing out from his Midoriya_'s body in a fluid gesture and sending Uraraka_'s Uraraka_'s rock coffin hurtling towards the edge -- 


With a guttural yell , Midoriya Midoriya_'s slams both his Midoriya_'s fists into the side of the stack and sends it flying at the opponent . The guy looks up in time for it to pummel into him Midoriya_'s , rocketing him Midoriya_'s away from Uraraka Uraraka_'s and towards the opposite edge . 


The impact from the blow sends a shudder up both of Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s arms and he Midoriya_'s swears he Midoriya_'s can feel them fracture in at least five different places . 


His Midoriya_'s arms become pure , unadulterated pain . 


He Midoriya_'s collapses . 


Everything seems hazy as he Midoriya_'s watches his Midoriya_'s missile erupt into a billowing cloud of dust , watches the_enemy Midoriya_'s emerge dirty but unscathed . The_man Midoriya_'s lifts his Midoriya_'s hands and Midoriya Midoriya_'s feels a disk slide under him Midoriya_'s and two disks rise to box him Midoriya_'s in on both sides , sending a new wave of searing heat through his Midoriya_'s arms . 


He Midoriya_'s ca n't move . 


His Midoriya_'s surroundings are shifting ; he Midoriya_'s 's speeding towards the edge and he Midoriya_'s 's accepted that there 's nothing he Midoriya_'s can do , that his Midoriya_'s exam is over . 


He Midoriya_'s clears the side and hangs in the great open space , right before that 20 foot plunge into icy water below -- 


But gravity never kicks in . 


He Midoriya_'s simply floats there , 20 feet above failure . And then he Midoriya_'s realizes . 


He Midoriya_'s lolls his Midoriya_'s head to the side and spots Uraraka Uraraka_'s , lower half still trapped in earth disks but right wrist frantically twisting to keep him Midoriya_'s up . The earthbender is nowhere to be seen . 


She adds her left arm to the movement , circling her hands over each other and towards herself , and Midoriya Midoriya_'s feels himself Midoriya_'s begin to drift back . 


When the ground is finally below him Midoriya_'s , Uraraka Uraraka_'s stops bending . Midoriya Midoriya_'s drops the 3 feet to the floor and gives a weak croak of protest on impact . His Midoriya_'s eyes drift to the clock in time to see big flashing zeroes -- 


`` Aaaaaand your exam is over ! '' Yamada yells over the intercom . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s blinks . 


All that training . All that work . And:


`` I got one hit . Just one hit , '' Midoriya Midoriya_'s moans , dropping his Midoriya_'s head to the ground . `` What kind of a bender am I ... '' 


There 's something wet on his Midoriya_'s cheek and he Midoriya_'s closes his Midoriya_'s eyes , trying to tune out the irrepressible pain shooting up his Midoriya_'s arms . It seeps into his Midoriya_'s brain , clouding his Midoriya_'s thoughts , and he Midoriya_'s fights to stay awake . 


`` ... him Midoriya_'s to the healers , now ! '' 


One hit . 


`` ... what was that stunt ... '' 


One hit . 


`` ... sure she 's okay , get her a bag ... . '' 


One hit . 


The acrid smell of vomit reaches his Midoriya_'s nose and everything is overwhelming -- the noises are overwhelming and his Midoriya_'s thoughts are overwhelming and the pain is overwhelming . 


`` ... he Midoriya_'s 's repeating one hit , why ... . '' 


I failed . 


His Midoriya_'s brain flickers off . 


He Midoriya_'s does n't eat much those next few days . 


His Midoriya_'s arms are healed , layers of bandages and worried looks from his Midoriya_'s mother the only evidence that anything happened . 


But the events of the exam plague his Midoriya_'s mind , looping over and over as he Midoriya_'s tries to settle back into normalcy , as he Midoriya_'s tries to come to terms with what just happened and what to do next . 


He Midoriya_'s 's not going to Yuuei . That much seems obvious . 


Sure , he Midoriya_'s stayed in the ring -- but no way that was enough to get him Midoriya_'s into the school , not when others were scoring hits by the hundreds . 


Bakugou Bakugou got in -- Midoriya Midoriya_'s does n't have to speculate on that . He Bakugou 's dreading seeing the smug look on his Bakugou face in class the day after they find out , feels nauseous thinking about facing the class when they knew what would happen the whole time . 


Maybe Uraraka Uraraka_'s got in . Maybe she 'll remember that silly earthbending kid that could n't even score a hit , take pity and call to hang out sometime . Maybe some good will actually come out of the exam . 


He Bakugou sits on the couch , squeezing a weight in his Bakugou fist and evaluating other schools to look into , other masters he Bakugou can learn from . 


But it feels wrong -- it feels like he Bakugou should be following in All Might 's steps and learning at Yuuei Yuuei . 


How is he Bakugou supposed to be great if he Bakugou is n't learning from the greats ? What important friendships would he Bakugou have made with the four nation 's up and coming leaders -- like the Fire Nation heir ? How much easier would the path ahead have been , had he Bakugou made those connections early ? 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s thinks of Todoroki 's empty , calculating eyes and shudders . 


True , the_prince Bakugou did n't seem so easy to befriend . But being classmates at Yuuei Yuuei would have been a good start . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s is trapped in a cycle of misery -- thinking of all that could have been and all that would never be . His Bakugou mother , the saint that she is , has allowed him Bakugou to mope for the week , only prompting him Bakugou to eat and go to school . But otherwise , she 's let him Bakugou be . She saw it coming and understands that he Bakugou needs time to come to terms . 


He Bakugou does n't respond when his Bakugou mom announces she 's going downstairs to grab the mail . But when he Bakugou hears the thud of feet running up the stairs , he Bakugou knows . 


`` I-Izuku ! '' His Bakugou mom cries , crashing into the living room and presenting him Bakugou a simple envelope . The Yuuei seal glistens on the front . `` It 's here ! '' 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s simply stares at the black lettering for a moment . 


Then he Bakugou silently rises from the couch , taking the letter from her hand and walking to his Bakugou room . The door closes behind him Bakugou with a resolute click and he Bakugou takes a deep breath . 


Welp , this is it . 


Here is the confirmation that he Bakugou needs a new plan . 


He Bakugou sits at his Bakugou desk , fingers hesitating at the seal . But impatience and curiosity soon overtake his Bakugou fears and he Bakugou rips it open , pulling the folded paper from inside and flattening it out . He Bakugou hungrily begins to read . 


`` Midoriya_Izuku Midoriya_Izuku , '' it Midoriya_Izuku begins , not sparing even a moment for pleasantries . `` The following letter encloses the results of your entrance exam to Yuuei Bending Academy . '' 


Below the sentence is a chart . Column one : Written Exam . Column two : Power output . Column three : Combat score . 


The written exam is what he Bakugou expected : he Bakugou passed . Not with flying colors , but with a sizeable margin . 


The power score is actually better than he Bakugou expected . 27 feet , a solid 10 feet above the average earthbending score . 


But the combat column is where he Bakugou trembles . The `` 1 '' draws his Bakugou eyes in like a magnet , confirming his Bakugou fears . 


He Bakugou did n't score nearly high enough to get in . 


He Bakugou 's toast . 


Resigned , he Bakugou lets his Bakugou eyes drift down to the sentence directly following the chart . 


`` Welcome to Yuuei . '' 


His Bakugou eyes skim over the words , then he Bakugou double-takes . He Bakugou backtracks and reads it again . 


It stays the same : `` Welcome to Yuuei . '' 


This has to be some sort of mistake . He Bakugou has to call them , to tell them they sent him Bakugou the wrong letter . 


He Bakugou skims the sentences below that , trying to gauge who the letter was actually meant for . The special observations section catches his Bakugou eye . 


`` Note that another examinee on your combat team expressed a wish to share hit points with you ; this tells us you are cooperative and show a good temperament for collaboration . '' 


Uraraka -- it has to be Uraraka . She wanted to share points with me ? 


`` While lacking in the hits category in combat , you made up for those lost points in the teamwork/rescue portion of the test . Your teachers will work with you on your offense , but you demonstrate promise in rescue fields or teamwork-oriented bending jobs . '' 


... Teamwork and cooperation ? 


His gaze leaps back up to the chart , honing in on a subsection he missed beforehand : rescue points . The whopping `` 59 '' under it sharply contrasts the `` 1 '' in the hits category . 


It 's not a mistake . 


He ... 


He actually got into Yuuei . 


A drop of water lands on the letter and blurs some of its ink , but Midoriya Midoriya_'s finds that he does n't care . It 's not until he starts crying in earnest that his mom worriedly raps on the door and asks to come in . 


Of course his first instinct is to tell All_Might All_Might . 


The former avatar probably already knows , what with their spiritual connection and his worldly contacts . But Midoriya Midoriya_'s wants to tell him in person regardless , to thank him for the help and to maybe get some advice on how to proceed . 


He 'll admit -- All_Might All_Might does n't seem so godlike anymore . If anything , he 's a source of comfort , a pillar of stability and of common experience that Midoriya Midoriya_'s lacks in the waking world . 


-LRB- Maybe All_Might All_Might is coming to feel less like something divine and more like family . -RRB- 


When Midoriya Midoriya_'s clambers into bed that night , he knows what to do . With his headphones playing a soft song for him , he lays flat on his back , gaze directed upwards towards the ceiling , and closes his eyes . 


He forces his heart to slow , makes himself ease his breathing and focus on the melody leaking into his ears . Breathe in, breathe out. His limbs melt into his bed . 


The music from his headphones gives way to a more all-encompassing hum -- the thrumming of the cosmos , of energy and space . He latches on , sees himself grab a fistful of that energy and watches it drag him into the unknown . 


When he opens his eyes again , he 's not in his familiar forest . 


It 's the Spirit World -- that much Midoriya Midoriya_'s can tell -- , but it 's nothing like the tranquility of the towering trees he 's grown to know . 


The landscape is best described as a desert -- but rather than sand , it 's covered in dust . A barren horizon : no plants , no buildings , no people . Everything looks gray and dead . The air is dry and scratchy , and every breath feels like an assault on his throat . 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s crouches to the ground , sifting a handful of the material through his Midoriya_'s fingers . It feels wrong . Something twinges in his Midoriya_'s chest and he Midoriya_'s ca n't say why , but something in the dust feels ... alive ? Tormented ? 


Is there someone buried here ? Was this dust formerly someone ? 


He Midoriya_'s begins to dig in haste -- looking for what , he Midoriya_'s does n't know . But if someone is in trouble , if someone is in pain , he Midoriya_'s has to help , he Midoriya_'s ca n't just leave them -- 


His Midoriya_'s hand brushes something solid and he Midoriya_'s halts for a moment . Then he Midoriya_'s starts again in earnest , frantically clawing at the dust . The thing begins to surface and , to his Midoriya_'s horror , he Midoriya_'s realizes that it 's a hand . 


He Midoriya_'s falls backwards on his Midoriya_'s butt , scooching away from the object . But it 's too late -- the hand shifts , free from its confinement , and spiders its way out of its dusty prison . 


Several things happen at once . 


The formerly stagnant air whips itself into a frenzy . Dust takes to the air , pelting Midoriya Midoriya_'s in sheets , invading his Midoriya_'s clothes , his Midoriya_'s eyes , his Midoriya_'s throat . He Midoriya_'s chokes -- more accurately , he Midoriya_'s drowns . 


The hand closes the gap , crawling over his Midoriya_'s foot and clamping onto his Midoriya_'s ankle . He Midoriya_'s wastes air and yelps , flailing his Midoriya_'s leg around desperately in an attempt to get it off . But his Midoriya_'s energy wanes ; he Midoriya_'s sinks , head hitting the ground . He Midoriya_'s can only watch the thing with his Midoriya_'s eyes , unable to escape . 


It might just be oxygen deprivation -- but Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s blurring vision witnesses the dust by the hand swirl and combine into a crude attempt at a human body . 


The mass climbs its way up his Midoriya_'s unmoving torso , crushing the remaining air in him Midoriya_'s even faster than before . Its rough head settles right over Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s . He Midoriya_'s tries to jerk his Midoriya_'s face away but finds that he Midoriya_'s ca n't . 


I know what you are , the words come , snake-like and tired and cold . 


Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s eyes widen ; he Midoriya_'s reaches at his Midoriya_'s last scraps of energy and renews his Midoriya_'s efforts to pull away . Instead , a dusty hand clamps down over his Midoriya_'s throat . He Midoriya_'s lets out a weak wheeze of agony . 


The thing leans in , almost brushing Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s nose . And then it laughs -- a nasally wheezing noise , a sad mockery of actual laughter . It sends a chill down Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s spine . 


It belts out one more raspy chuckle . If it had a mouth , Midoriya Midoriya_'s imagines it would be smiling . 


You think you 're safe ? That the world is safe ? it questions , a note of cruelty tinting its voice . 


Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s head lulls , his Midoriya_'s eyelids drooping shut and the tension draining from his Midoriya_'s body . 


How naive. 


His Midoriya_'s eyes are closed and he Midoriya_'s 's barely conscious but the next words are painfully clear . 


You obviously have no idea what 's coming . 


Something wraps firm arms under Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s armpits , yanking him Midoriya_'s under the mound of dust and into the earth . He Midoriya_'s swallows dust and sees no more . 


x


A shriek rips its way out of Midoriya_'s Midoriya_'s throat as he Midoriya_'s bolts upright . 


Escape . 


He Midoriya_'s has to escape . 


There 's something confining his Midoriya_'s legs -- 


He Midoriya_'s kicks his Midoriya_'s way out from under his Midoriya_'s sheets , stumbling from his Midoriya_'s bed and tripping onto the floor . 


The soft carpeting of his Midoriya_'s room . Gentle moonlight trickling in from shuttered windows . Rectangles of bending idols watching over him Midoriya_'s from the walls . 


He Midoriya_'s 's in the real world . 


He Midoriya_'s 's safe . 


Muffled footsteps scramble down the hall and his Midoriya_'s mother rips open the door , hair ruffled and terror on her face . 


“Izuku! What happened?” 


Midoriya Midoriya_'s ca n't help it . A tiny sob fights its way out of his Midoriya_'s chest , then another . 


He Midoriya_'s 's cried in front of his Midoriya_'s mom before . This Midoriya_'s is n't new . 


But it Midoriya_'s feels different -- it Midoriya_'s 's embarrassing . He Midoriya_'s 's supposed to hold up the whole world but he Midoriya_'s ca n't even hold himself Midoriya_'s together . 


He Midoriya_'s drops his Midoriya_'s face in his Midoriya_'s hands . 


His Midoriya_'s mom pauses in the doorway , assessing the scene . Then , no questions asked , she glides over and sinks to the floor , wrapping her arms around him Midoriya_'s in a comforting embrace . 


`` There there , Izuku , '' she murmurs , a hand rubbing up and down his Midoriya_'s back . `` It 'll all be okay . You 'll be fine . '' 


But it wo n't . And he Midoriya_'s wo n't . 


How is he Midoriya_'s supposed to go back to the Spirit World after that ? 


How is he Midoriya_'s supposed to talk to All Might with that thing there ? 


What is that thing ? What is it plotting ? 


How is he Midoriya_'s supposed to stop it ? 


In an instant , the weight of the world comes plummeting onto his Midoriya_'s back and he Midoriya_'s collapses under it , clinging to his Midoriya_'s mother and soaking her unknowing shoulders in the tears of a boy who was still precisely that : 


A boy .
