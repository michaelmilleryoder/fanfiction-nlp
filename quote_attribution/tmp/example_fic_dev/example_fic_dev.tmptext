A second trip to the local healing clinic -LRB- a hairline fracture -- easily fixed -RRB- and an awkward explanation to his mom later , Midoriya Midoriya is back at home and condemned from leaving the house -- regardless of whether or not he wants to test out his new abilities . 


But despite the house arrest , Midoriya Midoriya ca n't help but smile . His Midoriya mom seems pretty excited , too -- she witnessed his Midoriya rock firsthand , and although she ca n't entirely grasp how it took Izuku Izuku fourteen years to figure out bending , she 's ecstatic for her son . 


She bustles around the house , pulling out ingredients from the pantry and trying to tap at her phone at the same time . 


`` Oh , I 'm so excited for you , Izuku Izuku ! Earthbending! Can you believe it ? I 'm going to make you a cake . And I 'll call your father -- oh ! He 'll be so surprised ! He might want to come back in when he has a free day to say congrats -- '' 


`` Mom . Mom -- thank you . I 'm happy you 're excited , too , '' Midoriya Midoriya interrupts , walking over and leaning on the kitchen counter . He Midoriya smiles warmly . `` But seriously , you do n't have to make me Midoriya a cake . I Midoriya kind of just want to go to bed right now , I Midoriya 'm beat . '' 


She blinks , then beams back at him Midoriya . `` Oh , of course ! It 's been quite the day for you Midoriya -- I should have figured you Midoriya 'd want to sleep . '' 


She places her phone and rolling pin on the counter , shuffling over to her son . Standing on tiptoes , she deposits a kiss on Midoriya Midoriya 's forehead . 


`` I 'm very proud of you , '' she says softly . `` You never gave up , did you ? '' 


He Midoriya smiles , then shakes his Midoriya head slowly . She holds his Midoriya shoulders , tears beading at the corners of her eyes . 


He Midoriya kisses her forehead in turn , then pulling away to walk towards his Midoriya bedroom . 


`` Night , Mom . '' 


`` Goodnight , Izuku Izuku . '' 


The door closes behind him Midoriya and he Midoriya plops onto his Midoriya bed , dwelling on what a day it 's been . 


How could his Midoriya life have changed so much in 24 hours ? How could he Midoriya have gone from a non-bending nobody to the avatar ? 


Midoriya Midoriya flops backwards , and then the overwhelming nature of what comes next hits him Midoriya . 


He Midoriya needs to go back to_the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World to talk to All Might and figure out his Midoriya plan , pronto . 


The only method he Midoriya knows of is sleep -- when he Midoriya falls asleep , he Midoriya should be able to go there . 


So he Midoriya tries . He Midoriya lays on his Midoriya bed , staring blankly at the ceiling . 


This should be easy -- he Midoriya 's supposedly the bridge between the human world and the Spirit World , so he Midoriya should be able to cross over with no problem . He Midoriya just needs to focus , to try to meditate and cross that chasm . 


But as he Midoriya gazes upwards and tries to clear his Midoriya thoughts , muffled worries cloud his Midoriya mind . 


Why was n't I able to bend up until now ? What 's wrong with me ? 


Who do I talk to ? I do n't know what to do and I ca n't contact my only source of advice . 


What if I ca n't get into Yuuei ? How will I master bending if I do n't go there -- will I have to leave home ? Without telling my mom ? 


The_Spirit_World The_Spirit_World slips from his The_Spirit_World grasp and he The_Spirit_World shifts to his The_Spirit_World side with a weary sigh , resigning himself The_Spirit_World to a restless sleep . 


x


There 's no school the next day and his The_Spirit_World mom leaves the house telling him The_Spirit_World to stay put and rest -- but the second she closes the door behind her , he The_Spirit_World pulls on a jacket and slides on his The_Spirit_World shoes . 


He The_Spirit_World 's not well , but he The_Spirit_World ca n't rest easy until he The_Spirit_World knows the full extent of his The_Spirit_World bending abilities . He The_Spirit_World has to see if he The_Spirit_World can bend more than just earth and air . 


Past the back lot and under the cover of trees , Midoriya Midoriya comes to a stop . His Midoriya head still has that cotton feeling that dulls his Midoriya senses slightly , but overall he Midoriya feels much more focused and refreshed . He Midoriya uncaps a waterbottle and places it on the ground , then goes to stand five feet away . 


First up : waterbending . 


He Midoriya mimics the movements he Midoriya sees all the time on TV -- the back and forth , the pushing and pulling , the fluid arm circles . 


But the movements are too smooth , too gentle -- he Midoriya ca n't figure out how to transfer his Midoriya energy into the water without the powerful and decisive motions of earthbending . 


He Midoriya tries for a couple more minutes , then drops the positioning with a sigh . 


Okay , now for the one he Midoriya has even less hope with : firebending . 


It 's the same deal as waterbending ; he Midoriya goes through the pro motions , sharp jabs and thrusts . But the sheer emotion equated with firebending , the power that those benders display -- Midoriya Midoriya ca n't tap into it . 


Sure , he Midoriya 's got fight in him Midoriya . 


But he Midoriya ca n't seem to draw it out in the form of fire . 


He Midoriya treks back home , disappointed but not surprised . 


All that 's left to do now is to try to talk to All Might and get some answers . 


x


He Midoriya tries for a week : meditating , deep breathing , music . Anything to relax and help him Midoriya cross over . 


But nothing works . He Midoriya always begins to think of his Midoriya troubles , to worry about the path ahead . 


It 's a cycle -- his Midoriya anxiety means he Midoriya ca n't make it to the Spirit World , but not getting to the Spirit World is causing him Midoriya even more anxiety . It 's excessively stupid and he Midoriya knows that he Midoriya needs to calm down , to let his Midoriya worries go . 


But he Midoriya ca n't . That 's not in his Midoriya nature . 


It 's after another failed attempt that Midoriya Midoriya hoists himself Midoriya , blurry-eyed , from the bed . He Midoriya goes to sit at his Midoriya desk , head in his Midoriya hands , staring at the wood grain below . 


He Midoriya 's beginning to wonder if that whole thing with All_Might All_Might was a fever dream , that he Midoriya 's the avatar but he Midoriya never actually had that discussion with his Midoriya predecessor . 


Why is he Midoriya so bad at this ? Was n't this supposed to come naturally ? 


He Midoriya stares at the desk for another second , then raises his Midoriya head . Reaching for his Midoriya laptop , he Midoriya flips it open and frantically types . 


avatar life biographies 


It 's a dumb Google search , he Midoriya knows . But he Midoriya needs to know that he Midoriya 's not alone , that what he Midoriya 's going through is normal . 


He Midoriya clicks the first link and begins to read . 


An airbending avatar , 10 lifetimes back , that did n't master all the elements until she was 36 . A firebending avatar , 3 lifetimes ago , that struggled consistently with going into the Avatar State . Another earthbender , 8 lifetimes past , that avoided all other kinds of bending , finding them foreign and difficult . 


The story that comforts him Midoriya the most is All_Might All_Might 's . 


`` Avatar_Toshinori Avatar_Toshinori was reportedly unable to visit the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World until he Avatar_Toshinori was eighteen , '' the article reads . `` When asked about the most difficult part of his Avatar_Toshinori journey to become a fully-realized avatar , he Avatar_Toshinori responded with : ` the spiritual aspect . ''' 


Midoriya Midoriya stares at the words , a faint smile creeping on his Midoriya face . 


He Midoriya 's not alone . He Midoriya 's never been alone . His Midoriya struggle has been going on for centuries , and he Midoriya 's far from the first avatar to not know what to do . 


Even when a deep tiredness settles into his Midoriya bones , he Midoriya continues to scroll through his Midoriya past lives . 


He Midoriya feels connected . 


When he Midoriya begins to doze off , cheek on the desk and eyes still on the computer , there 's something like a humming that leaks into his Midoriya ears . He Midoriya lets his Midoriya eyes sink shut , and the humming overtakes him Midoriya , filling his Midoriya ears and sinking into his Midoriya limbs . 


He Midoriya lets it engulf him Midoriya . 


x


He Midoriya can sense the difference before his Midoriya eyes even flick open . 


The air around him Midoriya feels lighter , the ache of his Midoriya limbs fading and the weight of his Midoriya eyelids lessening . 


He Midoriya blinks , taking in the familiar clearing and lush greenery . But a quick survey shows that the former avatar is nowhere to be seen . 


A sense of panic settles in his Midoriya core . 


`` All_Might All_Might ? '' he Midoriya questions quietly . Only silence greets him Midoriya . Then it hits him Midoriya . 


It 's just silence -- no noise from the babbling stream or the insects from within the trees , like last time . Simply eerie quietness , thick and foreboding . 


Something 's wrong . 


Midoriya Midoriya whips around , suddenly growing paranoid that he Midoriya 's being watched . The landscape seems to darken , the shadows in between trees growing blacker and the foliage taking on a gray tint . He Midoriya nervously scans , trying to find the source of his Midoriya unease . 


A wave of something hits him Midoriya , grim and heavy . Gravity seems to grow exponentially stronger but he Midoriya fights it , struggling to stay upright and standing . Then he Midoriya sees it . 


Maybe it 's his Midoriya imagination -- there 's shifting on a tree 15 feet to his Midoriya left , almost a crawling motion , digits spidering their way across the trunk . Pale fingers ... 


A hand , but not attached to a body . 


He Midoriya chokes back a muffled cry of horror , stumbling a step before turning and sprinting in the opposite direction . 


He Midoriya runs from that evil aura , the emotions of hatred and vengeance and never-ending loneliness that threaten to swallow him Midoriya whole . Midoriya Midoriya is no expert on the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World , but he Midoriya knows that that is not supposed to be there . He Midoriya wheezes and weaves between trees , attempting to get away as fast as possible . 


The invading emotions slowly fade as he Midoriya puts distance between him Midoriya and the thing , to his Midoriya relief . He Midoriya slows down and leans against the thick trunk of a towering tree , trying to catch his Midoriya breath . 


But a new sensation appears , less of a feeling and more of a magnetic pull . It 's the polar opposite of what he Midoriya felt merely a few minutes ago : it 's hope , it 's reassurance and guidance . Midoriya Midoriya straightens up , tiredly shuffling in what he Midoriya thinks is the right direction . 


It is n't a far walk -- only about five minutes -- until he Midoriya reaches the edge of the forest , the overhead canopy making way to purple blue sky and sloping green hills . Midoriya Midoriya merely blinks slowly , until a voice calls his Midoriya name somewhere to his Midoriya left . 


He Midoriya turns to see the former avatar , picking his Midoriya way over tree roots towards him Midoriya . 


Thank god . 


Midoriya Midoriya walks over to meet him Midoriya , the man 's presence putting him Midoriya at ease . 


`` You have n't been here in a while , my boy , '' All_Might All_Might says , clapping Midoriya Midoriya on the back like an old friend rather than some kid he 's only met once . `` Troubles getting back to the Spirit World ? '' 


Midoriya Midoriya shrinks . `` Yes ... It took me Midoriya a bit to figure out how to get here , but I Midoriya think I Midoriya 've got it now . '' 


`` I Midoriya 'm glad -- I Midoriya 've got a feeling that there would have been trouble , had you learned any later . '' 


The man gives him a small smile and a final back pat , then turning to sit on a raised tree root . He seems relaxed , nonchalant . 


But something in his words bother Midoriya Midoriya . He hesitates , then asks . 


`` What do you Midoriya mean by ` trouble ? ''' 


All_Might All_Might freezes , like he 's been caught in some secret act . It All_Might feels ... weird , pressing his childhood hero to share information with him , but Midoriya Midoriya stays firm , fixing his mentor with a questioning stare . 


He has to familiarize himself with his past life . They have to be open with each other , and that connection starts with no secrets . 


Something in Midoriya Midoriya 's look must tell All_Might All_Might this ; he sighs . 


`` Well , I suppose you Midoriya would 've learned sooner or later , anyhow , '' All_Might All_Might says , scooching to the left and patting the root next to him . Midoriya Midoriya pauses , then walks over to sit . 


There 's a moment of silence as All_Might All_Might formulates what to say ; he fiddles those long fingers of his and stares straight ahead . Midoriya Midoriya just watches his Midoriya hands , letting the avatar think . 


The fingers stop promptly and Midoriya Midoriya locks eyes with his mentor , now donning a grim expression . 


`` I 'll cut to the chase : something dark is on the horizon , '' All_Might All_Might says , black eyes boring into Midoriya Midoriya 's . `` For both your world and mine . '' 


`` What ... What is it ? '' Midoriya Midoriya asks hesitantly . 


All_Might All_Might sighs . `` I Midoriya wish that I Midoriya knew , my Midoriya boy . '' 


`` Well , what makes you think that , then ? Have you been seeing something , had to fight someone ? '' 


All_Might All_Might rises and stands in front of Midoriya Midoriya , almost as if the very thought of evil on the horizon makes him restless . 


`` There 's a group -- a league , I should say -- that has been dabbling with affairs in both the human world and the_Spirit_World to_the_Spirit_World . I 've spotted them a few times here , and some of my human correspondents in your realm have gotten glances , too . '' All Might scratches at the top of his head , staring off into the woods . `` They 're not sending people here so much as they are sending entities ... Always a cloud of dark mist or a hand ... '' 


Midoriya Midoriya shudders and All_Might All_Might stops . 


`` Midoriya Midoriya ? Did you see one of them ? '' 


The boy fidgets . “Um, yes.” He fiddles with his fingers , looking down at the ground . `` I thought I spotted a hand ... It felt like it was watching me . . And it was radiating these awful emotions ... '' 


All Might mutters curses under his breath , stepping forward to place a hand on Midoriya Midoriya 's shoulders . 


`` I 'm sorry you had to witness that , my boy . I would be lying if I told you I knew what that thing is up to -- but I can say this , '' he says , locking eyes with his successor . `` Do n't try to find out what it is . Not yet.” 


Midoriya Midoriya breathes sharply . `` But , All Might -- '' 


`` You Midoriya 're not ready to face off with whatever this is , '' he cuts Midoriya Midoriya off . `` I Midoriya understand you Midoriya want to help , but for now the best thing you Midoriya can do is lay low and train . You Midoriya have a lot of missed time to make up for . '' 


He Midoriya has a point -- what could Midoriya Midoriya even do right now ? The boy slumps a little , the argument lost . 


`` Do n't worry , '' All_Might All_Might says . `` It has n't done anything too villainous , as of yet . Plus , I All_Might have contacts in the real world that are trying to find its source . We 'll know what it is , soon enough . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya tenses at `` contacts , '' recalling what he came here to ask about . `` Uh , All_Might All_Might , about the real world ... '' 


`` You Midoriya 're not sure what you Midoriya 're supposed to be doing , right ? '' All_Might All_Might responds . `` We 're connected -- I All_Might can feel your Midoriya confusion and apprehension towards the task at hand . '' 


The words stolen from his mouth , Midoriya Midoriya freezes for a second , then nods weakly . He shrugs away from the avatar 's grasp , rising from his seat and starting a nervous pace . 


`` I do n't even know where to start , '' he mutters , hand on his chin as he walks back and forth . `` Do I just come out and announce it ... '' 


`` Midoriya Midoriya . '' 


`` Or keep it quiet -- '' 


`` Breathe . '' 


`` Or just train in one element , or -- '' 


`` You 're overthinking this , my boy . '' 


`` But am I ? '' Midoriya Midoriya frantically shoots back , stopping in his Midoriya tracks . 


All_Might All_Might pauses , then belts out a laugh . 


It 's contagious -- Midoriya Midoriya ca n't help but crack into a smile , then a chuckle , and then a full laugh . 


They both laugh longer than the situation warrants , but when they finally stop , Midoriya Midoriya feels more relaxed . Something about the avatar just calls for calm -- in the face of the daunting , he Midoriya still manages to put on a smile . 


He Midoriya was n't the `` most charismatic avatar '' for nothing , Midoriya Midoriya guesses . 


`` I All_Might 'm sorry to laugh , kid -- I All_Might 'm just very happy to see you Midoriya so serious about this , '' All_Might All_Might says , seating himself again . `` Okay , back to business . You Midoriya know the traditional path an avatar takes . '' 


`` Yes : you 're told of their role when you turn sixteen and then you embark on your journey to master the elements . You go in the order of the Avatar Cycle -- for me , that would be earth , fire , air , water , '' Midoriya Midoriya says . `` But I 've already diverged from all of that . '' 


`` True , '' the former avatar agrees . `` You 're making yourself out to be quite the nontraditional case . But that 's okay . Some of the best avatars of the past have strayed from the tradition and turned out perfectly fine . '' 


`` Yeah , but I bet all of them were able to bend before they turned fourteen , '' Midoriya Midoriya murmurs , earning a sad look from All_Might All_Might . 


`` You ca n't dwell on that , Midoriya Midoriya , '' the man says softly . `` You 're a unique case . '' 


`` What did you say it was -- that my energy was blocked ? '' Midoriya Midoriya questions . `` How did it suddenly get unblocked ? Why was it blocked in the first place ? '' 


`` Like I said earlier -- it was a combination of different factors : emotional stunting , insecurity , et cetera , '' All_Might All_Might replies , shifting on his perch . He scratches the top of his head , looking somewhere off into the landscape behind Midoriya Midoriya 's shoulder . `` And -- er , this is n't for certain , but ... it may have also been my fault . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya tenses . “What?” 


The avatar sighs . `` My fight with All For One did n't just leave my body scarred . They tried to keep it from the public -- it would have sent everything into even more chaos , if they had -- but : there was a spiritual aspect to what the Rebellion was trying to accomplish , as well . 


`` All For One had two main goals : firstly , to gain control of Harmony Harmony and , by extent , all four nations . But their second , more ominous goal , was ... crazy . Theoretically impossible. Unless , that is , you had a stable bridge to take you back and forth from the Spirit World . '' 


`` He was interested in looking for bending energy sources in the Spirit World -- that is , places that could ` grant ' bending . I guess you could say he wanted to become a pseudo-avatar . '' 


It 's faint -- a slight hesitancy to All_Might All_Might 's words , a tiny pause that drops like lead into Midoriya Midoriya 's stomach . 


Is he afraid ? 


In an instant , All_Might All_Might suddenly seems so much smaller , so much more scared and lost and dead . 


Is this what 's in store for me , too ? Or will it be worse ? 


He shudders as All_Might All_Might begins to speak again . 


`` Now , whether places like that actually exist is entirely beyond my knowledge -- or if I could even take people with me when crossing worlds , but ... All For One wanted me to bring him to the Spirit World , regardless . And he was going to do it by force . '' 


`` So ... you were n't just fighting to stop them from taking Harmony Harmony , '' Midoriya Midoriya says . `` You were fighting to avoid being captured , too . '' 


All_Might All_Might nods . `` And what a fight it All_Might was . It All_Might took everything I had to hold him at bay . I 'm guessing you already know this , but I had to go into the_Avatar_State the_Avatar_State . No small feat , but it the_Avatar_State worked and I almost had him finished . But then I got hit . '' He grimaces at the memory , placing a hand over his concealed wound . `` I think that this was the first factor in blocking your energy . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya furrows his Midoriya brow . `` But ... sustaining injuries in the_Avatar_State the_Avatar_State is n't enough to end the_Cycle the_Cycle . Or block energy . '' 


`` You 're right , the injury itself Midoriya was n't what did it Midoriya , '' the man replies , with a hint of ... embarrassment ? Shame ? `` But after taking that hit , I was ... I did n't know if I would win , and I did n't want to be the one to end the_Cycle the_Cycle . So I went out of the_State the_Avatar_State for the rest of the fight . '' 


A lightbulb goes off in Midoriya Midoriya 's head . 


`` You were ashamed that you got scared for yourself , '' he states . `` And ashamed that you left the_State the_Avatar_State , even though staying in it the_Avatar_State could have ended the fight a lot sooner and saved more of the city . So you blocked a chakra point . '' 


All_Might All_Might blinks . `` Er . Yes. It seems like you know something about chakras . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya flushes , waving his Midoriya hands in apology . `` Oh , I 'm so sorry -- that was insensitive of me -- '' 


`` No , my boy , it 's fine . '' All_Might All_Might gives him Midoriya a small smile . `` Butting your Midoriya head into other people 's business is the mark of a good avatar . And it 's good to see you Midoriya already know about your Midoriya chakras -- those are important . '' 


The blood does n't leave Midoriya Midoriya 's face , and he Midoriya squeaks out a thank you Midoriya . 


`` So yes , like you Midoriya said , '' All_Might All_Might starts again slowly . `` I did n't resolve my own emotional issues in my lifetime , and ended up clogging my fire chakra -- willpower , blocked by shame . '' 


`` But why would that block all of my bending ? '' Midoriya Midoriya questions . 


`` Well -- my theory is that I did n't just have one chakra clogged . '' The man raises his right hand and points an index finger at his forehead . `` Thought chakra . Pure cosmic energy , blocked by worldly attachments . And I passed on with a lot of people that I wanted to save and a lot of people I wanted to bring to justice . '' 


`` And you think that carried over into my chakras , '' Midoriya Midoriya concludes . 


`` I 'll say that I was never quite as good at the whole ` spiritual aspect ' as some of the former avatars . So I do n't know if my running theory actually works , '' All_Might All_Might says . `` And while I 've come to terms with my fate and emotions , I had to fix the Thought Chakra in person -- but some sort of disconnect between us kept you from coming here for fourteen years . '' 


So that 's what the whole forehead thing was last time , Midoriya Midoriya thinks . But what kind of disconnect ... 


`` But what 's important is that you 're here now and you 've already bended two elements , '' All_Might All_Might says , interrupting Midoriya Midoriya 's thoughts . `` You 've also attempted water and fire , correct ? '' 


Midoriya Midoriya nods . `` But I was n't able to do either . I ca n't really figure out what I should be feeling when I bend those . '' 


`` Do n't rush it , '' All_Might All_Might advises . `` You 've only just entered the bending world , so start with earth , move to air , and then attempt the other two . Every avatar has an element they struggle with -- mine was fire . '' He looks Midoriya Midoriya up and down . `` And I feel like yours will be , as well . '' 


`` How can you tell ? '' 


All Might tents his hands , fingertips on his lips . `` You 'll find that most firebenders have found sources for their bending that are ... Self-destructive . Angry . Not the true essence of what firebending is intended to be . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya 's brain spits out a mental picture of a snarling Kacchan , which he Midoriya shoves down immediately . 


`` I Midoriya feel as though you 've only ever witnessed that kind of firebending in your life . You might attempt to start off on the wrong foot , without the right master , '' he Midoriya continues . `` And even then , it may take some time . The meanings of each element must be learned -- and as someone who 's always been on the receiving end of an angry firebender , its meaning might not come easy . '' 


The knowing look All_Might All_Might gives Midoriya Midoriya tells him Midoriya that he Midoriya knows all about Bakugou . Midoriya Midoriya returns a nervous smile . 


`` It will take time of course . I know you want to have a step-by-step plan , something to follow to the letter . But you must remember : a large aspect of being the avatar is following the flow of energy . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya must look confused , because the former avatar sighs . 


`` The flow -- whether it be in your bending , in conflicts , in your own life . You must learn to adapt accordingly and make split second decisions for the good of mankind , '' All_Might All_Might says . `` While I All_Might am here to give you advice , I All_Might am not always going to be there when you need to make tough choices in the spur of the moment . '' 


The boy already knew all that , but something about All Might saying it aloud makes it more real . 


`` Your hardships and battles will be different than mine All_Might . You can not copy me All_Might -- that 'll only end in tragedy . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya gazes up at his Midoriya predecessor , the weight of his Midoriya words settling on his Midoriya shoulders . 


He Midoriya can ask for guidance , but the final decisions will be up to him Midoriya . 


He Midoriya can save the world , but he Midoriya might not be able to save himself Midoriya . 


The nod of understanding he Midoriya gives feels like the click of a lock on his Midoriya heart . There 's no backing out ; his Midoriya fate is intertwined with that of the world . 


All_Might All_Might responds with a grim smile . 


`` So tell me All_Might , '' the man says , rising and turning to thread his way into the shadows of the trees . Midoriya Midoriya begins to follow , only to have the scenery around him flicker out like a lightbulb . He 's once again in that black void , nothing but him , darkness , and the boom of his mentor 's voice . 


`` What are you going to do ? '' 


He trains like hell . 


If he 's going to train under anyone , he needs to make sure that his bones do n't shatter first . 


His immediate goal : fortify his plans for the future , fortify his body , and fortify his mind . 


Step number one : build muscle , work on power output , and prep himself for the Yuuei Yuuei entrance exam . 


He 's been doing this for years -- fragmenting his long term goals into smaller ones , staving off the pressure of his future by compartmentalizing it . He 'll still have to save the world someday , but for now he just has to focus on getting into Yuuei Yuuei . 


As to why he 's so dead set on Yuuei Yuuei ... it 's less of a specific reason and more of a feeling . 


Simply put , it feels like fate . 


-LRB- Midoriya Midoriya ca n't deny that All Might attending the school in his Midoriya youth plays a big factor in the magnetism of the school . -RRB- 


But the abundance of masters teaching there , the interdisciplinary focus in the bending , the probable contacts All_Might All_Might has there -- it seems like a place specifically founded to groom avatars . 


So Yuuei it is . 


His Midoriya life becomes a collage of bending matches , gyms , and the quiet lot behind his Midoriya house . Anywhere where no one will stop him Midoriya from practicing . When he Midoriya 's not in school , he Midoriya 's sweating -- pulling up rocks , seeing which moves work for him Midoriya and which ones do n't . 


The internet helps him Midoriya more than he Midoriya would like to admit . Step-by-step power position tutorials , workout regiments , bending match videos -- they 're abundant and easily accessible , and Midoriya Midoriya finds himself Midoriya compiling all of their combined knowledge together until he Midoriya has a semblance of an actual workout schedule . 


x


There are two aspects to the Yuuei practical exam : power and combat . Midoriya Midoriya can learn combat moves by himself Midoriya by watching pro matches -- but the power portion might prove to be a challenge , without direction . 


He Midoriya ca n't figure out how to increase his Midoriya power . He Midoriya has a set limit , but honestly , it 's not enough . 


But when your mentor was notoriously good at interdisciplinary bending and using all of his Midoriya might in the fighting ring , it seems wasteful to just let that expertise slide . 


So Midoriya Midoriya finds himself Midoriya back in the Spirit World two weeks after their last encounter , luckily encountering no shadowy hands . 


He Midoriya pitches his Midoriya idea to All Might : teach Midoriya Midoriya the motions and logistics of a power-maximizing earthbending move to help him Midoriya pass the exam . 


The proposition brings a smile to All_Might All_Might 's face . He Midoriya beams , then places a large hand on Midoriya Midoriya 's head . 


`` Do n't worry , '' he Midoriya assures . `` I Midoriya have just the move in mind . '' 


x


It 's backbreaking work . Even sleep no longer offers a refuge , due to power sessions with All_Might All_Might . 


School , combat training , power practice , repeat . The months fly by and Midoriya Midoriya hardly notices . 


Of course there are moments when he doubts what he 's doing -- is Yuuei Yuuei actually worth this ? He 's the avatar -- ca n't he put off the hellish training until later ? He 's going to get a master no matter what , so why panic ? 


But as buzzes of the entrance exam begin to dance around the classroom , Midoriya Midoriya is painfully reminded that this is him catching up . That what he 's doing right now is making up for fourteen years of inactivity , fourteen years of missed bending experience . 


If he wants to train with the best , he has to put himself on equal footing first -- his spiritual title does not give him to a free ride to Yuuei . 


So despite his doubts , despite his fatigue , he pushes forward . He sees results . 


He 's sturdier , in mind and in body . He has an artillery of combat actions at his disposal . He has an All Might specialty move , guaranteed to max his power output . 


When ten months are up and the exam looms over the horizon , Midoriya Midoriya actually feels like he Midoriya 's standing at the starting line . 


Midoriya Midoriya shuffles past the Yuuei Yuuei gates , his Midoriya throat in his Midoriya stomach and his Midoriya legs trembling . 


He Midoriya did okay on the written portion -- a lot of it was interdisciplinary bending logistics , the history of bending , and what-would-you-do scenarios . There were only one or two he Midoriya did n't know at all , and a couple more he Midoriya was hesitant about , but it seems likely he Midoriya scored well . 


Now comes the tough part . 


He Midoriya 's forcing himself Midoriya to be calm , clasping his Midoriya hands together to stop their shaking and taking deep , controlled breaths . He Midoriya closes his Midoriya eyes . 


The worst that can happen is he Midoriya has to go to another bending school . He Midoriya 's prepared for this . He Midoriya 's done as much as he Midoriya can . It 's all a matter of showing that work now . 


Slightly calmer , Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes flick back open . A small smile creeps onto his Midoriya face and he Midoriya takes a big step forward -- 


Directly into a rock jutting out of the pavement . 


He Midoriya topples but his Midoriya mind stays strangely clear . 


Of course , his Midoriya brain sighs , resigned to its fate . Of COURSE you have to fall and break your arm right before the biggest exam of your life . You would n't be Midoriya Izuku if you did n't pull some clutzy move like this . So stupid. 


Right before he Midoriya gets a faceful of asphalt , however , there 's a whoosh and suddenly he Midoriya is n't falling . 


In fact , he Midoriya 's floating . 


Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes go wide and he Midoriya yelps , scrambling to get upright . The air begins to assist him Midoriya upwards , bringing him Midoriya from 20º to 90º . His Midoriya feet firmly planted on the ground again , Midoriya Midoriya turns to find his Midoriya savior . 


`` Are you okay ? '' A short girl with a gravity-defying bob smiles worriedly at him Midoriya , arms still raised from bending . Her big brown eyes look him Midoriya up and down , questioning and caring . 


Midoriya Midoriya merely stares . 


`` Sorry for not asking before using my Midoriya bending on you Midoriya , '' she continues , shifting her hands to grasp the strap of the satchel at her hip . `` I Midoriya figured it would be bad luck to trip before the exam ! '' 


She tilts her head and beams . 


Midoriya Midoriya feels himself Midoriya nearly go into cardiac arrest . 


`` Uh , '' he Midoriya eloquently responds . 


`` Well , we better get inside -- they 're starting soon . I 'm so nervous ! But let 's both do our best , okay ? '' 


`` Um , '' he Midoriya tries again . 


`` Good luck ! '' she says , turning to continue her way across the courtyard . Only his Midoriya eyes follow , watching the swish of her yellow skirt as she climbs the stairs and vanishes inside the building . 


He Midoriya does n't think of how mortifying that was . He Midoriya does n't think of how experienced the benders he Midoriya 's up against must be , for that girl to pull such a controlled stunt with no prep . He Midoriya does n't even think about the dreaded exam . 


His Midoriya brain simply spits out : 


I talked to a girl ! 


Midoriya Midoriya stands there , beaming like an idiot , until someone bumps into his Midoriya shoulder . 


`` Get moving , shitty Deku , '' they growl . 


It pulls him Midoriya out of his Midoriya reverie ; he Midoriya jumps at the sight of Kacchan 's red glare boring into him Midoriya -- but is then subsequently confused when the other boy just keeps walking forward to the doors . 


No taunting . No teasing . Nothing . 


It 's true that Bakugou this_time_Bakugou had been a lot more reserved following the ... incident . Whereas previous help from Midoriya Midoriya spurred on relentless insults , this_time_Bakugou this_time_Bakugou seemed recoil from any contact at all . Is he this_time_Bakugou ashamed ? Angry ? 


Either way , Midoriya Midoriya finds that the lack of attention -- positive or negative -- is off-putting . It feels like Bakugou this_time_Bakugou is plotting something . 


-LRB- Or that Bakugou this_time_Bakugou thinks he this_time_Bakugou 's plotting something . -RRB- 


Midoriya Midoriya tries to wipe that unease from his Midoriya mind , changing his Midoriya thoughts to the task ahead . He Midoriya sighs , then follows his Midoriya neighbor through those daunting doors . 


They 're greeted by a towering stage , the seats layered around it packed and chatter bouncing off the walls . A quick pitstop at the check-in table and the bestowing of the testing pack and seating assignments for the info session , then the two deposit themselves in chairs further back than Midoriya Midoriya would like . 


The silence from Bakugou this_time_Bakugou is deafening ; they both quietly pin on their numbers and pull on their armbands , neither acknowledging the other 's presence . 


The air is thick with tension , awkward shifting in seats and nervous gazes drifting over the throng of other students as they all await the test instructions . Some stretch in place , some control their breathing , and some just sit and stare . 


Midoriya Midoriya finds himself Midoriya in the last category , trying to push down the trembling in his Midoriya stomach as he Midoriya watches the experienced motions and sculpted muscles of the others around him Midoriya . 


What was he Midoriya thinking ? He Midoriya literally only learned how to earthbend -- what , ten months ago ? These kids have been bending their whole lives . Who was he Midoriya to think that he Midoriya could waltz in as some amateur and actually procure himself Midoriya a spot in the top bending school in the city ? 


Stupid, stupid, stupid. 


Midoriya Midoriya nervously adjusts the green armband on his Midoriya forearm -- an earthbender . Just an earthbender . 


He Midoriya needs to keep it that way . 


If people find out that he Midoriya 's the avatar , they also find out that All_Might All_Might is dead . The fragile peace that All_Might All_Might 's image has upheld since the rebellion collapses , and he Midoriya 's forced to deal with the aftermath -- untrained . Imagine the sheer panic that would arise when people found out their current avatar was n't even able to bend up until 10 months ago . 


He Midoriya might consider telling some of the Yuuei Yuuei staff if he Midoriya actually gets in -- some of them might already know , even -- , but it 's essential that he Midoriya keep this secret until he Midoriya 's mastered Earth at least . 


Of course , he Midoriya has to get into Yuuei Yuuei first . 


His Midoriya thoughts are interrupted when he Midoriya notices what appears to be their instructor . 


A man in airbending reds and yellows takes to the stage , swaggering over to the podium and tapping at the mic a few times . He Midoriya glances at some papers laid out in front of him Midoriya , then looks up at the crowd of students ahead . He Midoriya uses one hand to slick his Midoriya pointy yellow hair back , and the other to read whatever is written on his Midoriya notes . 


When he Midoriya 's done , he Midoriya looks up , smiles , and then shouts . 


`` HOW 'S IT GOIN ' , PROSPECTIVE YUUEI STUDENTS ? '' 


The students all slam their hands over their ears , the mic turned up way too high for someone who is obviously naturally pretty loud . 


The_man Midoriya glances at someone at the back of the stage , pulling his Midoriya mouth away from the mic . 


`` What -- you want me to ? '' He Midoriya gestures at the mic , then at himself Midoriya . More gesticulating , then a look of understanding . `` Oh , you want me to not use the mic ? Okay , that 's cool . That 's fair . '' 


He Midoriya steps away from the podium , then starts again . 


`` Sorry for that . Good morning , examinees ! I hope you 're ready to TEST ! '' 


Midoriya Midoriya gasps with recognition , clapping a hand over his Midoriya mouth . 


`` That 's -- that 's Yamada Hizashi ! Present Mic ! '' he Midoriya whispers excitedly . `` Bending match announcer and pro airbender for the -- '' 


`` Stop fangirling and fucking pay attention , dipshit , '' Bakugou this_time_Bakugou growls . Midoriya Midoriya shuts up instantly , but a smile still tugs at the corners of his Midoriya mouth . 


`` Let 's get right to it ! As you all know , Yuuei Yuuei is a multi-disciplinary combat school with a focus on bending and fighting 's active use in careers , '' Yamada Yamada says , gesturing at the Jumbotron behind him Midoriya as it blinks from the school logo to the number 2 . He Midoriya , in turn , raises two fingers . `` That 's why we 'll be testing you on two different aspects : power and combat . '' 


# 1 , the jumbotron reads . Power . 


`` First , we have to gage how much power you can put into your bending , '' Yamada Yamada explains . `` We need to have you at a certain caliber of bending before we can do any work with you . Airbenders will go for speed , firebenders for distance and heat , waterbenders for distance , and earthbenders for height . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya looks down at the table in front of him Midoriya . Yeah , he Midoriya 's been working on his Midoriya power output through his Midoriya sessions with All_Might All_Might , but he Midoriya is n't sure how that will stack up against the other benders here . He Midoriya 'll just have to do his Midoriya best . 


`` Remember : power comes from many different sources in bending , '' Yamada Yamada says , almost as a side-note . `` There 's sheer power , there 's technical power -- we do n't care whichever one you use , as long as your output is good . '' 


# 2 : Combat . 


`` And here 's the fun part -- the combat , '' the_man Midoriya says with a devious grin . Midoriya Midoriya gulps . 


`` We have multiple bending rings set up , each with their own stationed team , '' Yamada Yamada says , waving a hand at an animated fighting ring behind him Midoriya . `` We 've assigned you into teams of four . Your task is simple : beat the other team . '' 


A murmur goes across the room , students glancing at one another . 


`` Now , just beating the other team is n't gon na be enough to pass , of course . We 're grading you on a multitude of other things . But I 'll tell you this : the more hits you get on the other team , the better . You do n't want to be a bystander for this test . '' 


`` You 'll get more info on the combat portion right before you fight , '' Yamada Yamada says . `` But for now : go show us some power ! '' 


His following wink rallies the students ; there 's a burst in noise from the crowd , with students vying to escape their seats and get to the testing sites first . 


Midoriya Midoriya follows hesitantly behind them , the reality of his Midoriya competition now dawning on him Midoriya . 


x


They 're broken into groups and taken down to different testing sites . He Midoriya and Bakugou this_time_Bakugou are separated -LRB- thank god -RRB- , and he Midoriya does n't bother mingling with the other examinees as they walk out onto the field -- he Midoriya does n't think his Midoriya stomach could take it . 


It 's a typical green field , but with a painted white line differentiating the testing zone from the observation zone . The students amass right on the line . 


He Midoriya edges his Midoriya way to the front of the crowd , opting to fight his Midoriya nervousness by observing other students ' tests . As he Midoriya waits for the test to begin , someone chimes right next to him Midoriya . 


`` You Midoriya made it ! '' 


Midoriya Midoriya looks to his Midoriya left to see his Midoriya savior from earlier : the airbending girl . Somehow , they ended up in the same testing group -- Midoriya Midoriya is n't sure whether he Midoriya 's happy or sad about that . He Midoriya fidgets . 


`` U-uh . Yep ... '' 


She looks a little more serious from earlier , the smile she returns not making it all the way to her eyes . She must be nervous , too . 


`` Well , good luck ! '' Without another word , she goes back to watching the field . 


Midoriya Midoriya is grateful for her not wanting to small-talk -- he Midoriya would puke . 


The_proctor the_proctor makes his the_proctor way into the testing zone , scanning a clipboard . `` All right , '' he the_proctor begins . `` First , students here based on recommendation . Line up . '' 


A group of six students step forward , their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band . 


They represent all four elements , but they all have an air of confidence around themselves -- majority of them are guaranteed a spot at the school , whether it be due to money , ability , or both . 


Whereas Midoriya Midoriya had to fight just to stand at the starting line with everyone else , these people are already leagues ahead of him Midoriya . 


Their following displays are appropriately fantastic : a girl launches a water whip at break-neck speeds , some boy forces a column of rock at least three stories high . 


But the test that catches everyone 's attention is a boy with strange white and red hair . 


As he Midoriya takes to the field , something about him Midoriya seems familiar -- his Midoriya hair ? The dignity he Midoriya carries himself Midoriya with ? Midoriya Midoriya ca n't see his Midoriya face , but he Midoriya knows he Midoriya 's seen this kid before . 


The_examinee Midoriya seems to have tuned the rest of the world out . As soon as he Midoriya 's given the go ahead , he Midoriya swirls his Midoriya arms in a loose circle , wrists twisting and elegantly pulling and pushing . 


Midoriya Midoriya ca n't help but be entranced by the display ; they 're the moves of an experienced waterbender , but something looks off -- instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending , the motions look borderline angry , fast and sometimes even jagged . 


The boy 's palms spark . 


With a sharp jump and thrust , a jet of flames erupts from his hands , leaving a charred line of grass half a football field long . 


Midoriya Midoriya flinches . 


His eyes finally drift down to the boy 's armband : red . Fire Nation . But what kind of bending was that ? It was more waterbending than firebending -- and in a test where you 're try to maximize power output , you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique . 


The boy looks unfazed , merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression . It 's not until he turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya Midoriya spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his left eye and things click together . 


A scar . Strangely colored hair . Calm , removed . Firebending that looks like waterbending . 


That 's ... . 


That 's ... . 


`` Hey , um , '' the airbender girl says from beside him . `` You 're kind of staring . At Todoroki Shouto . Y’ know . The Firelord 's son . The one that hates staring . '' 


At the sound of his name , the prince turns and locks eyes with him . Midoriya Midoriya snaps out of his Midoriya trance , jerking to attention and whipping his Midoriya head to the side in a TOTALLY subtle attempt to play it off . 


`` W-was I ? '' he Midoriya nervously asks , eyes jumping across the backs of other testers , at the buildings -- anywhere but Todoroki Todoroki . `` Haha , oops ... '' 


The girl starts laughing , to which a nearby boy almost immediately chimes in to tell her that laughing during an exam is disrespectful , and she ought to be ashamed , and if she aims to be a top bender , she should be paying extremely close attention , and a million other things that Midoriya tunes out . When he Midoriya gages it 's been long enough , he Midoriya shyly peeks at the prince again . 


Todoroki Todoroki 's mismatched eyes are still trained on him Midoriya , the quiet intensity of his Midoriya gaze making Midoriya Midoriya fidget . It feels like he Midoriya 's being analyzed -- like this boy is sinking under his Midoriya skin and paging through his Midoriya weaknesses and secrets . 


It 's scary . 


The prince finally looks away and Midoriya Midoriya releases a breath he Midoriya did n't know he Midoriya was holding . 


`` Can I go ? '' Todoroki Todoroki asks , turning to the test proctor . `` I Todoroki 've done my Todoroki required testing . '' 


`` I Todoroki 'm afraid not , Your Highness , '' the_proctor the_proctor says . `` You have to stay here until all examinees have finished the power gaging portion of the exam . I the_proctor 'm sorry for all the formalities , but -- well , rules are rules . '' 


Todoroki Todoroki sighs , then calmly moves his way off the testing lawn and into the crowd . He accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line , a buzzcut-headed airbender , but does n't apologize and keeps moving . The airbender side-eyes him before stepping up to test . 


The prince looks robotic . Icy . Not anything like what would be expected of the Firelord 's son . 


What happened to him ? What must his home life be like , to make him that cold ? 


But Midoriya Midoriya is brought back to his Midoriya current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field , ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes . Oh, right. He Midoriya has to go up against that . 


He Midoriya twitches in place as the_proctor the_proctor tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd . 


`` That concludes the recommendee testing , '' the_proctor the_proctor says . `` Now we 'll move on to standard testing -- and I the_proctor must remind recommendees that they 're to stay put for this portion , as well . '' He Midoriya glances at Todoroki , who has melted somewhere into the back of the crowd . 


`` Everyone , please section off into your respective elements . '' 


With a shy smile , he Midoriya and the airbending girls part ways . The_proctor the_proctor announces the order of elements : water , earth , fire , air . 


The following displays are n't as intimidating as the recommendees ' , but they still put Midoriya Midoriya on edge . The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies , nonchalantly blasting streams across the field . 


When they move onto earthbending , Midoriya Midoriya starts feeling intimidated . 


Yes , Midoriya Midoriya has put on weight and packed on muscle . But he 's still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he sees on his fellow earthbenders . Sculpted calves , broad backs , and flat pecs -- Midoriya Midoriya feels like he accidentally signed up for a bodybuilding show that he was horribly unprepared for . 


But All_Might All_Might 's advice comes to mind . 


Midoriya Midoriya , there 's a misconception about earthbending that you Midoriya 're fixated on , he remembers All Might telling him one session when he was getting particularly frustrated with the move . 


Know this : muscle mass does not equate to power . 


No , power in bending comes from the strength of your Midoriya own internal energy -- your Midoriya body must be able to hold that power , of course , but your Midoriya main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you Midoriya push it into the elements . 


Midoriya Midoriya breathes deeply . Focus on himself Midoriya . Focus on doing the move right . He Midoriya almost does n't notice the test in front of him Midoriya has finished . 


The_proctor the_proctor pauses for a moment before reading the next name . 


`` Midoriya Midoriya Izuku . '' 


He Midoriya jumps at the sound of his Midoriya name , then begins to edge his Midoriya way through the crowd with slumped shoulders . 


The prolonged look the_proctor the_proctor gives him Midoriya feels too significant to ignore -- does he Midoriya knows ? Does everyone in Yuuei know ? He Midoriya swallows hard , then assumes his Midoriya power stance . 


Midoriya Midoriya gazes down at his Midoriya hands , trying to calm his Midoriya heartbeat and praying he Midoriya 's not about to do something that is n't earthbending . 


`` Whenever you 're ready , Midoriya Midoriya , '' the_proctor the_proctor says , making the boy flinch . 


Okay , Midoriya Midoriya : remember your training . You worked with All_Might All_Might on this -- you should have this in the bag . He Midoriya shifts , steadying his Midoriya feet and shifting his Midoriya weight into his Midoriya heels . This is the easy part . 


A deep breath . 


Then he Midoriya begins . 


The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending -- in a slow and deliberate movement , Midoriya Midoriya moves his Midoriya arms upwards from his Midoriya core and out in a circle . His Midoriya hands meet at the top ; he Midoriya calmly lowers them , clasped over his Midoriya heart . 


Draw power from your core , he Midoriya hears All Might say . Bring your heart 's energy into your hands , then out through your feet and into the ground . 


Midoriya Midoriya imagines that energy transfer , sees his Midoriya power bleed out of his Midoriya chest and into his Midoriya hands . 


Down and steady , my boy . 


His Midoriya hands move lower towards the ground , dragging the energy into the earth below . 


And… Now! 


Midoriya Midoriya thrusts his Midoriya hands skyward in a singular decisive movement , the ground following the motion . He Midoriya holds it , waits for the rumbling above to halt . And then he Midoriya breaks stance , oddly drained after the display . 


He Midoriya cranes his Midoriya head upwards , panting . It rivals the earthbending he Midoriya 's seen thus far -- it might even be higher . 


But the important thing is that he Midoriya actually did it . 


He Midoriya actually correctly did the move All_Might All_Might taught him Midoriya . 


He Midoriya exits the bending zone with a small smile on his Midoriya face , bubbling with internal pride . It makes him Midoriya feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam -- at least he Midoriya performed well on one half of the practical . He Midoriya settles into the crowd , content to silently watch the next bending feats . 


“Hey.” 


It 's a hollow voice , cool and controlled . Midoriya Midoriya turns to look at the speaker , ready to greet them in turn . 


He Midoriya flinches when he Midoriya sees it 's none other than the Fire Nation Prince , Todoroki_Shouto Todoroki_Shouto . 


-LRB- Is he Midoriya supposed to bow ? Prostrate on the floor and kiss his Midoriya shoes ? Oh god what is he Midoriya supposed to do . -RRB- 


Midoriya Midoriya instead opts to blink at the other boy , lost for words . Todoroki Todoroki must be used to awed silence -- he Midoriya speaks in Midoriya Midoriya 's stead . 


`` That was an All Might specialty move , '' the prince states , unwavering . 


“Um. Y-yes ? '' Midoriya Midoriya says . 


Todoroki Todoroki does nothing but continue to stare and Midoriya Midoriya mentally slaps himself for forgetting . 


`` Oh god , I mean -- yes , Your Highness , '' Midoriya Midoriya backtracks , face suddenly hot and palms uncomfortably sweaty . `` I admired -- '' 


`` Do n't call me that , '' Todoroki Todoroki objects . “Please. I ca n't stand it when people associate me with my jerk of a father . '' 


Midoriya Midoriya reels at the nonchalant insult -- of course , there were rumors that the heir did n't get along with the_Firelord the_Firelord , but to be so open about it the_Firelord ... . 


Todoroki_Shouto Todoroki_Shouto must truly not care about family image . 


“Okay…. Todoroki Todoroki , '' Midoriya Midoriya stammers . `` But , um , yes , I admired All_Might All_Might a lot as a kid , and I picked up a lot of his bending tricks from watching his matches . '' 


`` That one stunt combines aspects of firebending with a basic earthbending move in order to amplify power output , '' Todoroki Todoroki says without missing a beat . `` It 's supposed to take years to master -- they say you can only learn it at Yuuei or from All Might himself . '' 


Is it hot out here ? Or is it just Midoriya Midoriya ? God , it 's boiling . 


Haha , I 'm so dead . 


`` I. Well . Hm , '' Midoriya Midoriya stammers , pulling at his Midoriya collar and cringing under Todoroki Todoroki 's steady gaze . `` I Midoriya guess ... I Midoriya 'm just a quick learner ? '' 


Todoroki Todoroki does n't move and Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes flick around the surrounding crowd , desperately avoiding eye contact . The sensation of his Midoriya skin being peeled back by the prince 's gaze has now amplified into the feeling of his Midoriya skin being flayed . It takes all of his Midoriya willpower to avoid scampering off . 


`` ... Sure , '' Todoroki Todoroki says finally in the voice of someone utterly unconvinced . He Midoriya scans Midoriya Midoriya one more time , then turns without comment and walks back into the crowd . 


Midoriya Midoriya resists the urge to start hyperventilating . 


He Midoriya gets the sense that he Midoriya just had a very close call , even though there 's no way in hell that Todoroki Todoroki could have known anything about some common Earth Kingdom kid like him Midoriya . It was the sheer speculative power of the prince alone that nearly blew his cover -- that , and Midoriya Midoriya 's horrendous ability to keep secrets . 


If he Midoriya actually gets into Yuuei Yuuei , he Midoriya 'll have to watch himself Midoriya around the heir . 


He Midoriya watches the rest of the examinees in a daze . It 's one amazing performance after the next -- they blend together in his Midoriya mind and he Midoriya finds himself Midoriya both intimidated and inspired . 


This is what he Midoriya could be if he Midoriya gets into Yuuei Yuuei . 


This is the power he Midoriya could practice beside , the people he Midoriya could befriend . 


-LRB- He Midoriya tries to ignore the sensation of mismatched , suspicious eyes attached to his Midoriya back . -RRB- 


When the final test is complete , the_proctor the_proctor calls for them to gather into their respective elemental groups and to head inside -- further instructions will be provided there . 


Midoriya Midoriya leaves the field , a sense of foreboding lodging itself in his Midoriya stomach . 


x


When he Midoriya finds out the second portion of the match involves them wearing pro-bending uniforms , it 's simultaneously a nightmare and a dream-come-true . 


He Midoriya stands in front of the strewn out clothes , knowing he Midoriya needs to dress fast but taking his Midoriya time regardless . How many times has he Midoriya wanted to do this ? To wear these uniforms , to fight in the pro-bending ring ? 


But he Midoriya finds he Midoriya ca n't get any pleasure from it right now -- the stakes are too high . 


The rules of the match echo through his Midoriya head as he Midoriya pulls off his Midoriya own sweats and picks up the black shirt and pants . 


`` This wo n't be your normal pro-bending match , with rounds and territory gains , '' Yamada shares , seated backwards in a chair in the small classroom . He Midoriya looks far too casual for something that will make or break Midoriya Midoriya 's future . 


`` Instead , it 's one 5-minute round , with your sole objective being to push the other team off the back . '' 


The padded underclothes are tight and restrictive ; Midoriya Midoriya yanks them on and wishes he Midoriya had asked for a size up . He Midoriya 's grown more than he Midoriya thought he Midoriya had . 


`` The bare minimum to pass is KO'ing the other team . Individual scoring is based on how many hits on your opponents you each make . '' 


He Midoriya shrugs the thick padding on over his Midoriya shoulders , yanks the green sash around his Midoriya waist tighter , and deposits the helmet on his Midoriya head . He Midoriya exits the room , swerving a left and going to the entry hall . 


`` You 'll want to keep as many of your teammates in the ring as you can , while also getting in as many hits on the enemy as possible . '' 


The lights of the arena are blinding ; he Midoriya squints as he Midoriya stumbles his Midoriya way into the ring . He Midoriya pays no mind to his Midoriya teammates , solely focused on calming himself Midoriya down before the match . 


`` If you fall out of the ring , you fail . '' 


He Midoriya closes his Midoriya eyes and inhales deeply . This is it . 


Some voice in the back of his Midoriya head prompts him Midoriya to wonder how Bakugou Bakugou_he_thinking_about is faring in all of this -- but considering this is Bakugou_he_'s_thinking_about Bakugou_he_thinking_about he Midoriya 's thinking about , there 's no reason to be worried . 


He Midoriya needs to focus on himself Midoriya . 


“Hi again!” 


Midoriya Midoriya jumps at the cheery voice interrupting his Midoriya thoughts , then flushes when he Midoriya spots the speaker : pixie bob girl . 


`` Looks like we 're on the same team , huh ? '' she notes , eyes skimming over Midoriya Midoriya , then the other two team members behind him Midoriya . `` The other two do n't seem to be terribly friendly . The waterbender glared at me when I tried to talk to him Midoriya and the firebender was a little zoned out . I do n't think they 're into the whole teamwork thing , y’ know ? '' 


`` Uh-huyeah , '' Midoriya Midoriya says , internally slapping himself Midoriya for the mix of gibberish he Midoriya ca n't help but spew . 


Luckily , the girl does n't seem to mind . Maybe she 's used to it . `` Oh well , I guess we 'll just have to watch each others ' backs . I 'm Uraraka Uraraka , by the way ! '' 


Uraraka Uraraka : bright , beautiful . How fitting. 


`` M-Midoriya , '' he Midoriya replies . 


`` Nice to meet ya , Midoriya Midoriya ! '' She drops her helmet on her head , gives him Midoriya a final smile and thumbs up , then paces ahead of him Midoriya to the middle line . 


Well , at least that 's one advantage . Uraraka Uraraka seems to be a pretty experienced bender -- even if airbending is n't terribly offensive , she 'll still cover for him Uraraka . 


It 's a small comfort but a comfort nonetheless ; he Uraraka joins his Uraraka team at the start point . 


The following information the referee spits out sound like meaningless garble in his ears . Not that it matters -- he already knows the rules by heart . Instead , he takes the time to focus himself , to peek glances at his opponents and teammates . 


The other team is just as terrifying as he anticipated . He 's not sure if they 're Yuuei students or hired benders , but they 're older and hardened . They look sure of themselves and their bending , and face the prospective students with countenances of grim determination . 


His team is ... not quite so confident . Like Uraraka Uraraka said , the firebender looks dazed and confused . The waterbender looks near murderous . 


But the face that scares him the most is Uraraka Uraraka 's . Gone is her Uraraka cheery disposition and airy smile ; instead , all he sees is icy willpower . Her Uraraka eyes pick apart the other team as well , dancing over their arms and legs and gauging their faces . 


This girl means business . 


Rather than put him at ease , it disorients him further -- he 's not the only one desperate to get in here . Is sabotage an option in this match ? What if she Uraraka steals points from him ? 


Quit it , quit it , quit it ! He scolds himself internally , too lost in thought to notice the teams slowly edging towards their back boundaries and the ref raising a pointed hand . 


There 's literally no logic in Uraraka Uraraka trying to beat you ! You 're on the same team , you both have to survive ! Regardless , you 'll get enough points anyway , you 've done the work and -- 


`` -- riya ! '' 


He startles , whipping around to see Uraraka Uraraka shouting at him . 


`` They 're about to start ! '' 


He stumbles into Zone_1 Zone_1 and tries to sink into fighting position when a sharp voice booms overhead . Midoriya Midoriya looks upwards , pupils shrinking in shock . 


`` ... 2 , 1 : GO . '' 


He does n't even have time to blink before something solid thumps into his stomach , sending him tumbling backwards and into Zone_2 Zone_2 . He wheezes a curse under his breath and then hauls himself to his feet , scanning the scene ahead . 


The match can only have been going on for ten seconds , but it 's already sheer chaos . The arena is a multitude of one-on-one battles : his waterbender is trying to get a blow on the opposing airbender , their firebender is being relentlessly pelted with stone disks -- she 's already in Zone 3 , yikes -- , and Uraraka Uraraka is cartwheeling across Zone_1 Zone_1 to avoid fire blasts . 


Midoriya Midoriya raises a disk and angles it to hit the enemy earthbender , but then he Midoriya realizes . 


Wait. 


... Where 's their waterbender ? 


The answer comes with a jet of water to the stomach . He Midoriya lands on his Midoriya butt but then uses his Midoriya ground contact to his Midoriya advantage , shooting out energy through the floor and calling for a nearby stone disk . The disk soars to his Midoriya hands , which he Midoriya then wields as a makeshift shield against the water strikes . The gaping hole in the middle means it does n't offer as much protection as he Midoriya 'd like , but it 's all that he Midoriya 's got . 


The blasts come in one-second intervals and with all the force of a train ; he Midoriya peeks from around the side of his Midoriya blockade to see the waterbender , at the edge of his Midoriya Zone 1 and with firmly planted feet . 


Okay -- he Midoriya has to somehow distract the waterbender to keep from getting blasted , then aim a disk at him Midoriya to score a point . But how? 


His Midoriya eyes leap across the field , settling on the duel between his Midoriya team 's waterbender and the enemy airbender . That fight is almost over -- one more hit on the airbender and she 'll be off the back . 


Time for a risk . 


Midoriya Midoriya waits for a water-free moment , then flings his Midoriya shield as hard as possible at the airbender . 


It does n't connect , but it disorients her ; taking advantage of the distraction , his Midoriya team 's waterbender propels a column of water towards the enemy that hits her dead-on . She soars to the back of the arena and over the edge . 


Nice. One enemy down and one teammate free to assist . 


He Midoriya gets pelted with water again -- but with nothing free to block it , the force pushes him Midoriya uncomfortably close to the Zone 3 line . Gritting his Midoriya teeth , he Midoriya leans into the stream so he Midoriya 's on his Midoriya hands and knees . 


As soon as the water lets up , he Midoriya leaps upright , stomping the ground and summoning another disk from the ground . He Midoriya 'll have to make this fast . 


He Midoriya keeps up the disk 's momentum with his Midoriya arms , flinging the rock and his Midoriya energy directly at the waterbender , poised for a direct hit and his Midoriya first point -- 


Water makes it to the enemy first , slamming into him Midoriya and pushing him Midoriya into Zone_2 Zone_2 . Midoriya Midoriya 's disk whizzes overhead and out of the ring . Midoriya Midoriya drops his Midoriya arms and cranes his Midoriya head to look at the water 's source . 


His Midoriya teammate , wheeling his Midoriya arms and prepping another water blast , does n't even look at him Midoriya as he Midoriya shoots the enemy waterbender off the back and out of the ring . So much for teamwork . 


-LRB- They only have two enemies left now , but Midoriya Midoriya finds he Midoriya ca n't be happy about it . -RRB- 


A glance at the clock : 2 minutes left . 


Holy crap , only two minutes left already ? He Midoriya still does n't have any points ! Who’s even left to hit? 


Their firebender must have been knocked out -- she 's nowhere to be seen . But the odds are still in their favor : three versus two . 


Uraraka Uraraka is now engaged with the earthbender -- she 's struggling , but she 's staying put in Zone_1 Zone_1 . The firebender stands in the middle of Zone_2 Zone_2 , looking to pick a fight . 


Okay , there 's Midoriya Midoriya 's target . 


The firebender , however , notices him Midoriya first : she volleys off a round of fireballs right at him Midoriya . He Midoriya 's forced to roll to the side . He Midoriya pushes onto his Midoriya feet and breaks into a run when the fire keeps coming . 


He Midoriya 's only done defense so far -- but what else can he Midoriya do ? How can he Midoriya fight when the_enemy Midoriya wo n't even let him Midoriya plant himself Midoriya and utilize his Midoriya bending ? 


Nearing the edge of the Zone 2 and Uraraka Uraraka 's fight , he Midoriya has no choice but to turn around and backtrack -- he Midoriya 's going to get hit . 


Unless he Midoriya gets a distraction ... . 


“Uraraka!” Midoriya Midoriya shouts , praying that she 'll be able to spare a moment . `` Some air , please ! '' 


She jerks at her name , looking towards Midoriya Midoriya and narrowly sidestepping an oncoming earth disk from her opponent . Her gaze jumps over his Midoriya fight , and then a spark of understanding leaps into her eyes . She nods . 


Whole arms twisting in a full-body circle , she inhales deeply and holds . 


Midoriya Midoriya shifts his Midoriya core to head back in the direction he Midoriya came from . 


Uraraka Uraraka exhales and hell breaks loose . 


Something resembling a tornado erupts from her , spiraling towards the enemy firebender and redirecting her fireballs into a now fiery vortex . Eyes wide under her helmet , the opponent runs into Zone_3 Zone_3 to dodge it Zone_3 . 


Now! Now Midoriya Midoriya can go for the hit . He Midoriya plants himself Midoriya , raising a disk . 


But before he Midoriya can even aim it Zone_3 , the wind catches up to the firebender . She soars upwards , then off the edge and into the watery pit below along with the tornado . 


Midoriya Midoriya stares , desperation clawing at his Midoriya core . 


`` One hit ! '' he Midoriya cries in frustration . `` I Midoriya just need one hit ! '' 


He Midoriya looks dully at the scene ahead -- there 's just one more person to score hits on , and Uraraka Uraraka seems to have that fight on lock . Or maybe the waterbender will try to snatch points from him Midoriya again , if he Midoriya 's still here . 


Turning around , however , the waterbender is nowhere to be found . It looks like it 's just him Midoriya and Uraraka Uraraka . But she 's more than capable -- if he Midoriya tried to interfere , he Midoriya 'd probably just mess her up . 


There 's a dull thud and someone yelps . Midoriya Midoriya whips around to see Uraraka Uraraka pinned under an earth disk , the opposing team 's earthbender stalking over . He Midoriya gives a harsh stomp and a disk slides under his Midoriya captive , the sharp motion making her wheeze . 


Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes flit over to the clock : 30 seconds . 30 seconds until they win . 


However , if Uraraka Uraraka gets knocked out of the ring and it 's just him Uraraka and this other guy left ... Then they have to face off in a tiebreaker . 


Which , yes , is an opportunity for actual points , if Midoriya Midoriya wins . 


But it also means that Uraraka Uraraka fails . 


Midoriya Midoriya thrusts his Midoriya hands upwards and raises a disk from the ground . He Midoriya repeats the motion again , and again , and again until he Midoriya has a 10-foot stack of disks hovering directly in front of him Midoriya . He Midoriya grunts under the strain , legs screaming in protest , but he Midoriya manages to stay upright . 


Meanwhile , the_enemy Midoriya is in position , arms pushing out from his Midoriya body in a fluid gesture and sending Uraraka Uraraka 's rock coffin hurtling towards the edge -- 


With a guttural yell , Midoriya Midoriya slams both his Midoriya fists into the side of the stack and sends it flying at the opponent . The guy looks up in time for it to pummel into him Midoriya , rocketing him Midoriya away from Uraraka Uraraka and towards the opposite edge . 


The impact from the blow sends a shudder up both of Midoriya Midoriya 's arms and he Midoriya swears he Midoriya can feel them fracture in at least five different places . 


His Midoriya arms become pure , unadulterated pain . 


He Midoriya collapses . 


Everything seems hazy as he Midoriya watches his Midoriya missile erupt into a billowing cloud of dust , watches the_enemy Midoriya emerge dirty but unscathed . The_man Midoriya lifts his Midoriya hands and Midoriya Midoriya feels a disk slide under him Midoriya and two disks rise to box him Midoriya in on both sides , sending a new wave of searing heat through his Midoriya arms . 


He Midoriya ca n't move . 


His Midoriya surroundings are shifting ; he Midoriya 's speeding towards the edge and he Midoriya 's accepted that there 's nothing he Midoriya can do , that his Midoriya exam is over . 


He Midoriya clears the side and hangs in the great open space , right before that 20 foot plunge into icy water below -- 


But gravity never kicks in . 


He Midoriya simply floats there , 20 feet above failure . And then he Midoriya realizes . 


He Midoriya lolls his Midoriya head to the side and spots Uraraka Uraraka , lower half still trapped in earth disks but right wrist frantically twisting to keep him Midoriya up . The earthbender is nowhere to be seen . 


She adds her left arm to the movement , circling her hands over each other and towards herself , and Midoriya Midoriya feels himself Midoriya begin to drift back . 


When the ground is finally below him Midoriya , Uraraka Uraraka stops bending . Midoriya Midoriya drops the 3 feet to the floor and gives a weak croak of protest on impact . His Midoriya eyes drift to the clock in time to see big flashing zeroes -- 


`` Aaaaaand your exam is over ! '' Yamada yells over the intercom . 


Midoriya Midoriya blinks . 


All that training . All that work . And:


`` I got one hit . Just one hit , '' Midoriya Midoriya moans , dropping his Midoriya head to the ground . `` What kind of a bender am I ... '' 


There 's something wet on his Midoriya cheek and he Midoriya closes his Midoriya eyes , trying to tune out the irrepressible pain shooting up his Midoriya arms . It seeps into his Midoriya brain , clouding his Midoriya thoughts , and he Midoriya fights to stay awake . 


`` ... him Midoriya to the healers , now ! '' 


One hit . 


`` ... what was that stunt ... '' 


One hit . 


`` ... sure she 's okay , get her a bag ... . '' 


One hit . 


The acrid smell of vomit reaches his Midoriya nose and everything is overwhelming -- the noises are overwhelming and his Midoriya thoughts are overwhelming and the pain is overwhelming . 


`` ... he Midoriya 's repeating one hit , why ... . '' 


I failed . 


His Midoriya brain flickers off . 


He Midoriya does n't eat much those next few days . 


His Midoriya arms are healed , layers of bandages and worried looks from his Midoriya mother the only evidence that anything happened . 


But the events of the exam plague his Midoriya mind , looping over and over as he Midoriya tries to settle back into normalcy , as he Midoriya tries to come to terms with what just happened and what to do next . 


He Midoriya 's not going to Yuuei . That much seems obvious . 


Sure , he Midoriya stayed in the ring -- but no way that was enough to get him Midoriya into the school , not when others were scoring hits by the hundreds . 


Bakugou Bakugou got in -- Midoriya Midoriya does n't have to speculate on that . He Bakugou 's dreading seeing the smug look on his Bakugou face in class the day after they find out , feels nauseous thinking about facing the class when they knew what would happen the whole time . 


Maybe Uraraka Uraraka got in . Maybe she 'll remember that silly earthbending kid that could n't even score a hit , take pity and call to hang out sometime . Maybe some good will actually come out of the exam . 


He Bakugou sits on the couch , squeezing a weight in his Bakugou fist and evaluating other schools to look into , other masters he Bakugou can learn from . 


But it feels wrong -- it feels like he Bakugou should be following in All Might 's steps and learning at Yuuei Yuuei . 


How is he Bakugou supposed to be great if he Bakugou is n't learning from the greats ? What important friendships would he Bakugou have made with the four nation 's up and coming leaders -- like the Fire Nation heir ? How much easier would the path ahead have been , had he Bakugou made those connections early ? 


Midoriya Midoriya thinks of Todoroki 's empty , calculating eyes and shudders . 


True , the_prince Bakugou did n't seem so easy to befriend . But being classmates at Yuuei Yuuei would have been a good start . 


Midoriya Midoriya is trapped in a cycle of misery -- thinking of all that could have been and all that would never be . His Bakugou mother , the saint that she is , has allowed him Bakugou to mope for the week , only prompting him Bakugou to eat and go to school . But otherwise , she 's let him Bakugou be . She saw it coming and understands that he Bakugou needs time to come to terms . 


He Bakugou does n't respond when his Bakugou mom announces she 's going downstairs to grab the mail . But when he Bakugou hears the thud of feet running up the stairs , he Bakugou knows . 


`` I-Izuku ! '' His Bakugou mom cries , crashing into the living room and presenting him Bakugou a simple envelope . The Yuuei seal glistens on the front . `` It 's here ! '' 


Midoriya Midoriya simply stares at the black lettering for a moment . 


Then he Bakugou silently rises from the couch , taking the letter from her hand and walking to his Bakugou room . The door closes behind him Bakugou with a resolute click and he Bakugou takes a deep breath . 


Welp , this is it . 


Here is the confirmation that he Bakugou needs a new plan . 


He Bakugou sits at his Bakugou desk , fingers hesitating at the seal . But impatience and curiosity soon overtake his Bakugou fears and he Bakugou rips it open , pulling the folded paper from inside and flattening it out . He Bakugou hungrily begins to read . 


`` Midoriya_Izuku Midoriya_Izuku , '' it Midoriya_Izuku begins , not sparing even a moment for pleasantries . `` The following letter encloses the results of your entrance exam to Yuuei Bending Academy . '' 


Below the sentence is a chart . Column one : Written Exam . Column two : Power output . Column three : Combat score . 


The written exam is what he Bakugou expected : he Bakugou passed . Not with flying colors , but with a sizeable margin . 


The power score is actually better than he Bakugou expected . 27 feet , a solid 10 feet above the average earthbending score . 


But the combat column is where he Bakugou trembles . The `` 1 '' draws his Bakugou eyes in like a magnet , confirming his Bakugou fears . 


He Bakugou did n't score nearly high enough to get in . 


He Bakugou 's toast . 


Resigned , he Bakugou lets his Bakugou eyes drift down to the sentence directly following the chart . 


`` Welcome to Yuuei . '' 


His Bakugou eyes skim over the words , then he Bakugou double-takes . He Bakugou backtracks and reads it again . 


It stays the same : `` Welcome to Yuuei . '' 


This has to be some sort of mistake . He Bakugou has to call them , to tell them they sent him Bakugou the wrong letter . 


He Bakugou skims the sentences below that , trying to gauge who the letter was actually meant for . The special observations section catches his Bakugou eye . 


`` Note that another examinee on your combat team expressed a wish to share hit points with you ; this tells us you are cooperative and show a good temperament for collaboration . '' 


Uraraka -- it has to be Uraraka . She wanted to share points with me ? 


`` While lacking in the hits category in combat , you made up for those lost points in the teamwork/rescue portion of the test . Your teachers will work with you on your offense , but you demonstrate promise in rescue fields or teamwork-oriented bending jobs . '' 


... Teamwork and cooperation ? 


His gaze leaps back up to the chart , honing in on a subsection he missed beforehand : rescue points . The whopping `` 59 '' under it sharply contrasts the `` 1 '' in the hits category . 


It 's not a mistake . 


He ... 


He actually got into Yuuei . 


A drop of water lands on the letter and blurs some of its ink , but Midoriya Midoriya finds that he does n't care . It 's not until he starts crying in earnest that his mom worriedly raps on the door and asks to come in . 


Of course his first instinct is to tell All_Might All_Might . 


The former avatar probably already knows , what with their spiritual connection and his worldly contacts . But Midoriya Midoriya wants to tell him in person regardless , to thank him for the help and to maybe get some advice on how to proceed . 


He 'll admit -- All_Might All_Might does n't seem so godlike anymore . If anything , he 's a source of comfort , a pillar of stability and of common experience that Midoriya Midoriya lacks in the waking world . 


-LRB- Maybe All_Might All_Might is coming to feel less like something divine and more like family . -RRB- 


When Midoriya Midoriya clambers into bed that night , he knows what to do . With his headphones playing a soft song for him , he lays flat on his back , gaze directed upwards towards the ceiling , and closes his eyes . 


He forces his heart to slow , makes himself ease his breathing and focus on the melody leaking into his ears . Breathe in, breathe out. His limbs melt into his bed . 


The music from his headphones gives way to a more all-encompassing hum -- the thrumming of the cosmos , of energy and space . He latches on , sees himself grab a fistful of that energy and watches it drag him into the unknown . 


When he opens his eyes again , he 's not in his familiar forest . 


It 's the Spirit World -- that much Midoriya Midoriya can tell -- , but it 's nothing like the tranquility of the towering trees he 's grown to know . 


The landscape is best described as a desert -- but rather than sand , it 's covered in dust . A barren horizon : no plants , no buildings , no people . Everything looks gray and dead . The air is dry and scratchy , and every breath feels like an assault on his throat . 


Midoriya Midoriya crouches to the ground , sifting a handful of the material through his Midoriya fingers . It feels wrong . Something twinges in his Midoriya chest and he Midoriya ca n't say why , but something in the dust feels ... alive ? Tormented ? 


Is there someone buried here ? Was this dust formerly someone ? 


He Midoriya begins to dig in haste -- looking for what , he Midoriya does n't know . But if someone is in trouble , if someone is in pain , he Midoriya has to help , he Midoriya ca n't just leave them -- 


His Midoriya hand brushes something solid and he Midoriya halts for a moment . Then he Midoriya starts again in earnest , frantically clawing at the dust . The thing begins to surface and , to his Midoriya horror , he Midoriya realizes that it 's a hand . 


He Midoriya falls backwards on his Midoriya butt , scooching away from the object . But it 's too late -- the hand shifts , free from its confinement , and spiders its way out of its dusty prison . 


Several things happen at once . 


The formerly stagnant air whips itself into a frenzy . Dust takes to the air , pelting Midoriya Midoriya in sheets , invading his Midoriya clothes , his Midoriya eyes , his Midoriya throat . He Midoriya chokes -- more accurately , he Midoriya drowns . 


The hand closes the gap , crawling over his Midoriya foot and clamping onto his Midoriya ankle . He Midoriya wastes air and yelps , flailing his Midoriya leg around desperately in an attempt to get it off . But his Midoriya energy wanes ; he Midoriya sinks , head hitting the ground . He Midoriya can only watch the thing with his Midoriya eyes , unable to escape . 


It might just be oxygen deprivation -- but Midoriya Midoriya 's blurring vision witnesses the dust by the hand swirl and combine into a crude attempt at a human body . 


The mass climbs its way up his Midoriya unmoving torso , crushing the remaining air in him Midoriya even faster than before . Its rough head settles right over Midoriya Midoriya 's . He Midoriya tries to jerk his Midoriya face away but finds that he Midoriya ca n't . 


I know what you are , the words come , snake-like and tired and cold . 


Midoriya Midoriya 's eyes widen ; he Midoriya reaches at his Midoriya last scraps of energy and renews his Midoriya efforts to pull away . Instead , a dusty hand clamps down over his Midoriya throat . He Midoriya lets out a weak wheeze of agony . 


The thing leans in , almost brushing Midoriya Midoriya 's nose . And then it laughs -- a nasally wheezing noise , a sad mockery of actual laughter . It sends a chill down Midoriya Midoriya 's spine . 


It belts out one more raspy chuckle . If it had a mouth , Midoriya Midoriya imagines it would be smiling . 


You think you 're safe ? That the world is safe ? it questions , a note of cruelty tinting its voice . 


Midoriya Midoriya 's head lulls , his Midoriya eyelids drooping shut and the tension draining from his Midoriya body . 


How naive. 


His Midoriya eyes are closed and he Midoriya 's barely conscious but the next words are painfully clear . 


You obviously have no idea what 's coming . 


Something wraps firm arms under Midoriya Midoriya 's armpits , yanking him Midoriya under the mound of dust and into the earth . He Midoriya swallows dust and sees no more . 


x


A shriek rips its way out of Midoriya Midoriya 's throat as he Midoriya bolts upright . 


Escape . 


He Midoriya has to escape . 


There 's something confining his Midoriya legs -- 


He Midoriya kicks his Midoriya way out from under his Midoriya sheets , stumbling from his Midoriya bed and tripping onto the floor . 


The soft carpeting of his Midoriya room . Gentle moonlight trickling in from shuttered windows . Rectangles of bending idols watching over him Midoriya from the walls . 


He Midoriya 's in the real world . 


He Midoriya 's safe . 


Muffled footsteps scramble down the hall and his Midoriya mother rips open the door , hair ruffled and terror on her face . 


“Izuku! What happened?” 


Midoriya Midoriya ca n't help it . A tiny sob fights its way out of his Midoriya chest , then another . 


He Midoriya 's cried in front of his Midoriya mom before . This Midoriya is n't new . 


But it Midoriya feels different -- it Midoriya 's embarrassing . He Midoriya 's supposed to hold up the whole world but he Midoriya ca n't even hold himself Midoriya together . 


He Midoriya drops his Midoriya face in his Midoriya hands . 


His Midoriya mom pauses in the doorway , assessing the scene . Then , no questions asked , she glides over and sinks to the floor , wrapping her arms around him Midoriya in a comforting embrace . 


`` There there , Izuku , '' she murmurs , a hand rubbing up and down his Midoriya back . `` It 'll all be okay . You 'll be fine . '' 


But it wo n't . And he Midoriya wo n't . 


How is he Midoriya supposed to go back to the Spirit World after that ? 


How is he Midoriya supposed to talk to All Might with that thing there ? 


What is that thing ? What is it plotting ? 


How is he Midoriya supposed to stop it ? 


In an instant , the weight of the world comes plummeting onto his Midoriya back and he Midoriya collapses under it , clinging to his Midoriya mother and soaking her unknowing shoulders in the tears of a boy who was still precisely that : 


A boy .
