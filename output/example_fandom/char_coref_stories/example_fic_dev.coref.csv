7759693,2,282,"A group of six students step forward , their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band . 
"

"

"
7759693,2,289,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) ca n't help but be entranced by the display ; they 're the moves of an experienced waterbender , but something looks off -- instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending , the motions look borderline angry , fast and sometimes even jagged .

"
7759693,2,293,"His eyes finally drift down to the boy 's armband : red . Fire Nation . But what kind of bending was that ? It was more waterbending than firebending -- and in a test where you 're try to maximize power output , you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique . 
"
7759693,2,294,"The boy looks unfazed , merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression . It 's not until he turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya ($_midoriya) spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his left eye and things click together . 
"
7759693,2,295,"A scar . Strangely colored hair . Calm , removed . Firebending that looks like waterbending .

"
7759693,2,302,"Todoroki_'s ($_todoroki) mismatched eyes are still trained on him ($_midoriya) , the quiet intensity of his ($_midoriya) gaze making Midoriya ($_midoriya) fidget .

"
7759693,2,307,"Todoroki ($_todoroki) sighs , then calmly moves his way off the testing lawn and into the crowd . He accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line , a buzzcut-headed airbender , but does n't apologize and keeps moving . The airbender side-eyes him before stepping up to test . 
"
7759693,2,308,"The prince looks robotic . Icy . Not anything like what would be expected of the_Firelord_'s ($_the) son . 
"
7759693,2,309,"What happened to him ? What must his home life be like , to make him that cold ? 
"
7759693,2,310,"But Midoriya ($_midoriya) is brought back to his ($_midoriya) current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field , ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes . Oh, right. He ($_midoriya) has to go up against that .

7759693,2,311,"He ($_midoriya) twitches in place as the_proctor ($_the) tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd .

"
7759693,2,314,"With a shy smile , he ($_midoriya) and the airbending girls part ways . The_proctor ($_the) announces the order of elements : water , earth , fire , air . 
"
7759693,2,315,"The following displays are n't as intimidating as the recommendees ' , but they still put Midoriya ($_midoriya) on edge . The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies , nonchalantly blasting streams across the field . 
"
7759693,2,316,"When they move onto earthbending , Midoriya ($_midoriya) starts feeling intimidated . 
"
7759693,2,317,"Yes , Midoriya ($_midoriya) has put on weight and packed on muscle . But he 's still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he sees on his fellow earthbenders .

"
7759693,2,318,"But All_Might_'s ($_all) advice comes to mind . 
"
7759693,2,319,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) , there 's a misconception about earthbending that you ($_midoriya) 're fixated on , he remembers All Might telling him one session when he was getting particularly frustrated with the move . 
"
7759693,2,320,"Know this : muscle mass does not equate to power . 
"
7759693,2,321,"No , power in bending comes from the strength of your ($_midoriya) own internal energy -- your ($_midoriya) body must be able to hold that power , of course , but your ($_midoriya) main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you ($_midoriya) push it into the elements . 
"
7759693,2,322,"Midoriya ($_midoriya) breathes deeply . Focus on himself ($_midoriya) . Focus on doing the move right . He ($_midoriya) almost does n't notice the test in front of him ($_midoriya) has finished . 
"
7759693,2,323,"The_proctor ($_the) pauses for a moment before reading the next name . 
"

"
7759693,2,325,"He ($_midoriya) jumps at the sound of his ($_midoriya) name , then begins to edge his ($_midoriya) way through the crowd with slumped shoulders . 
"
7759693,2,326,"The prolonged look the_proctor ($_the) gives him ($_midoriya) feels too significant to ignore -- does he ($_midoriya) knows ? Does everyone in Yuuei know ? He ($_midoriya) swallows hard , then assumes his ($_midoriya) power stance .

7759693,2,330,"A deep breath . 
"
7759693,2,331,"Then he ($_midoriya) begins . 
"
7759693,2,332,"The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending -- in a slow and deliberate movement , Midoriya ($_midoriya) moves his ($_midoriya) arms upwards from his ($_midoriya) core and out in a circle .

7759693,2,339,"He ($_midoriya) cranes his ($_midoriya) head upwards , panting . It rivals the earthbending he ($_midoriya) 's seen thus far -- it might even be higher .

"
7759693,2,341,"He ($_midoriya) actually correctly did the move All_Might ($_all) taught him ($_midoriya) . 
"
7759693,2,342,"He ($_midoriya) exits the bending zone with a small smile on his ($_midoriya) face , bubbling with internal pride . It makes him ($_midoriya) feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam -- at least he ($_midoriya) performed well on one half of the practical . He ($_midoriya) settles into the crowd , content to silently watch the next bending feats . 
"
7759693,2,343,"“Hey.” 
"
7759693,2,344,"It 's a hollow voice , cool and controlled . Midoriya ($_midoriya) turns to look at the speaker , ready to greet them in turn .
